Since this post, I have extensively studied non-linear PKM software, such as [Roam](https://roamresearch.com/), [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), [Logseq](https://logseq.com/), and [Foam](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/). I acknowledge that I misunderstood the concept of manual linking; that PKM software performs a fuzzy search to intelligently identify linked and unlinked references. I found some PKM software with automatic linkings, such as [Saga](https://saga.so) or [Weavit](https://www.weavit.ai/). But none of them worked how I expected. Manual linking helps refine the database. So, even if I make a Next-gen digital brain, I will not remove the linking process.

Well, you're now watching my next-gen digital brain! For the past two weeks, I have worked on the [WWW project](https://github.com/anaclumos/extracranial) that built this website. It checks off almost all of the marks detailed in this post!
