description: 'I developed a browser extension for Chrome and Firefox that attracted 750K visitors and 500K installs, with 230K active users. Despite acquisition offers and Microsoft's challenges to my app, I persevered until warned for trademark rights violations. I ceased the project, finding open-source development emotionally taxing, unsustainable, and overwhelmed by user feedback. Contributions were scarce. I'm now aiming to create a sustainable, value-driven service.'
