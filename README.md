# Project WWW — which became [cho.sh](https://cho.sh)

I am Sunghyun Cho, traveling the world wide web. This repo is my interpretation of a second brain on the web. I wrote a [post](https://cho.sh/blog/D8FB8E) imagining such creation before making this website. It would be entertaining for you to compare how similar and different I built this project from my imagination.

I never expected this project to end up on such a consequential scale. This project started as a test flight on investigating how Docusaurus could handle "multiplex" data, which surprised me with its capability. Then I started adding a bunch of features from a post where I initially imagined what I would've done if I had created a Digital Brain. Now that it is stable and performant, I hereby open-source this project. I hope anyone around the 🌐 will gain from this.

> **Warning**<br/>
> I haphazardly git-committed the first few hundred commits. Also, I use my terminal shortcut to auto-deploy to Vercel by git-committing a "trivial note update." This workflow will undoubtedly break if other people start to fork this repo — but that's a [Maserati Problem](https://www.quora.com/Whats-a-Maserati-Problem#:~:text=It%27s%20a%20problem%20you%20shouldn%27t%20be%20worried%20about%20at%20the%20current%20stage.); I'll probably figure it out in the future! So meanwhile, if you want to use this repo for yourself, you will have to put some effort. Good luck!
