PARA is a second-brain framework designed by Tiago Forte.

|Type|Detail|Examples|
|----|----|----|
|Projects|Tasks with deadline & their sequences|Work, Side Projects, etc. |
|Areas|Tasks that require continuous attention|Life, Relationships, etc. |
|Resources|Topics that hold extended interest|Research, Studies, Hobbies, etc. |
|Archive|Literally Archiving|Past or Expired Projects, Areas, Resources, etc. |

I plan on implementing PARA on this digital brain.
