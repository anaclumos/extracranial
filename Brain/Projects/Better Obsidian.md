Some things that I currently don't like about [[Obsidian]]:

- Aliases should have consistency with normal links.
  - `Personal Knowledge Management` and `PKM` should act the same.
  - Not in some weird format like `PKM|Personal Knowledge Management`.
- Advanced Templating
  - run functions like `getRandomHex()` when creating new posts
- Exclude URLs in unlinked mentions
  - See [Exclude backlink mentions in link markup from suggested backlinks - Feature archive - Obsidian Forum](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/exclude-backlink-mentions-in-link-markup-from-suggested-backlinks/7092)
- Encapsulate Markdown File to Folder
  - `Brane.md` â†’ `Brane/Brane.md`
  - For Foldering Purposes
