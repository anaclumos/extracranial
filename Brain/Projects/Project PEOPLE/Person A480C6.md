- Interviewed at: [[2022-09-08]]
- Currently works at [[Apple]], [[Apple]] Silicon Team
- Studied Electrical Engineering in school
  - Took a lot of science classes
  - MS in Chips
- Works as an SoC Engineer
  - Joined the M1 team just before the announcement
  - Worked on the A16 chip this year (2022)
- _[[Apple]] Silicon Team_ isn't necessarily a hardware team
  - Ex) Chip Design Inspection Software
- **DRI**. Direct Response Individual.
  - [[Project PEOPLE]] can take responsibility, regardless of their level and position.
- One downside: [[Apple]] is a very secretive company.
  - Every permission is on a _need-to-know_ basis.
  - Siloed Culture.
  - However, communications are very active across the team.
- If I leave [[Apple]]
  - I would search for a smaller team for more flexibility.
- It would've been better to have more constructive undergrad vacations.
- Engineers are like knives; you should keep working to keep yourself sharp.

Working at the biggest, most hyped company is a huge plus, especially when they have a huge event.
[[Apple]] also has a sound responsibility system — e.g., DRI.
