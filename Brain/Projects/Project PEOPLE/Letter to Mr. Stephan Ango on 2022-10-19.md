Dear Engineer Ango,

I am Sunghyun Cho, a computer science student based in Los Angeles.
I recently came across your article on Photoshop for Text and was deeply inspired by it.
I am also heavily interested in Tools for Thought and Digital Brains and would like to keep in touch.
I also have a Memex or, my term, _Extracranial_ at [https://cho.sh](https://cho.sh/).

You also have your page there!

- Your Page: [https://cho.sh/r/6A9784](https://cho.sh/r/6A9784)
- Synthote: [https://cho.sh/r/9A0D39](https://cho.sh/r/9A0D39)

If you are wondering, yes, I use Obsidian for my Memex, but I have built a custom React application for presenting on the web instead of Obsidian Publish.
You are located here :)

I hope we can keep in touch!

Best Regards,  
Sunghyun Cho
