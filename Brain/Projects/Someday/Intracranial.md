## Definition

- [[FIRE Engine]]
- Aim to implement Zettlekasten
- Uses
  - PencilKit
  - [[Atomic Notes System]]
  - [[Infinite Canvas]]
- Notes can refer to notes (like Hepta)
- Can view relation graphs
- Gesture Recognition: draw a certain shape to tag/link notes

## Problem

- After using Zettlekasten for a while, taking notes as document files kinda suck.
- I want to take notes with my iPad.

## Prodrafts

- I was using [Prodrafts](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/prodrafts/id1545810067), but it has limits:
  - 👍 Infinite canvas
  - 👍 Native PencilKit support
  - 👍 [[Apple]]-ish design language
  - 👎 Unable to construct Zettlekasten
    - 👎 No graphing
    - 👎 No backlinking
    - 👎 No referencing
  - 👎 Poor i18n support (initially targeted for Chinese users.)
    - 👎 Significant portion is untranslated
