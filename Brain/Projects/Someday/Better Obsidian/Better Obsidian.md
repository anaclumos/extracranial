## Extension Ideas for [[Obsidian]]

  - `Personal Knowledge Management` and `PKM` should act the same.
  - Not in some weird format like `PKM|Personal Knowledge Management.`
  - At least convert one to another.

  - Run functions like `getRandomHex()` when creating new posts
- Exclude URLs in Unlinked Mentions
  - See [Obsidian Forum 7092](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/exclude-backlink-mentions-in-link-markup-from-suggested-backlinks/7092).
- Encapsulate File to Folder `Topic.md` â†’ `Topic/Topic.md`
- Review Page for Daily Notes
  - List view for Daily Notes like [[Roam Research]] and [[Logseq]].
- Auto Delete Empty Files
- Lint Supports
- MDX Supports
- Prettier for Code Blocks
- Anonymized Images
