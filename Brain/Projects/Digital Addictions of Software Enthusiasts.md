title: 'Digital Addictions of Software Enthusiasts'

## Outline

I aspire to the new horizon of knowledge that Computer Science brings.
However, I also despise the malicious use of that technology that preys upon human consciousness and infects human health.
I also find myself addicted to digital media, knowing the very fact.
I had difficulty consciously separating _I like software_ and _I like software by all means._
Think this way:
The fascinating science behind nuclear physics and the wrath of atomic weapons are _separate_.
Similarly, information technology and the decaying consciousness of digital addictions are irrelevant.

As a Software Enthusiast, I had difficulty overcoming this because it was physically impossible to separate myself from the internet.
For example, if I were a poet, I could've simply cut off the wire and continued my work and life.

I tried this in 2019.
Using a 10-year-old iPhone 3GS running iOS6 as my main phone, I untethered myself from the internet.
I only used limited capabilities like phone calls, messages, music, and reminders.

However, I cannot do this anymore.
As a software engineer and computer scientist, I always require internet access for my work and projects.
The lure and attraction are always in reach.
The question became:

> Would there be a way to get the most out of the groundbreaking knowledge repository of the internet _without_ getting overwhelmed by fast-paced, attention-grabbing media, shortening my interest span, or succumbing to the radicalized uncivil data?
