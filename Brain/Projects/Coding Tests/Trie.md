> In [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science 'Computer science'), a **trie**, also called **digital tree** or **prefix tree**, is a type of [$k$-ary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M-ary_tree 'M-ary tree') [search tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_tree 'Search tree'), a [tree](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure)> 'Tree (data structure)') [data structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure 'Data structure') used for locating specific keys from within a set. These keys are most often [strings](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_(computer_science)> 'String (computer science)'), with links between nodes defined not by the real key, but by individual [characters](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_(computing)> 'Character (computing)'). To access a key (to recover its value, change it, or remove it), the trie is traversed [depth-first](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search 'Depth-first search'), following the links between nodes, which represent each character in the key.
