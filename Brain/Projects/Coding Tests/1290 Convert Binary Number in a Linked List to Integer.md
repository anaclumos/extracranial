## Question

Given `head` which is a reference node to a singly-linked list. The value of each node in the linked list is either `0` or `1`. The linked list holds the binary representation of a number.

Return the _decimal value_ of the number in the linked list.

The **most significant bit** is at the head of the linked list.

## Solution

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def getDecimalValue(self, head: ListNode) -> int:
        value = head.val
        while head.next:
            value *= 2
            head = head.next
            value += head.val
        return value
```
