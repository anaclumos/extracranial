> A **greedy algorithm** is any [algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm 'Algorithm') that follows the problem-solving [heuristic](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristic_(computer_science)> 'Heuristic (computer science)') of making the locally optimal choice at each stage. In many problems, a greedy strategy does not produce an optimal solution, but a greedy heuristic can yield locally optimal solutions that approximate a globally optimal solution in a reasonable amount of time.
