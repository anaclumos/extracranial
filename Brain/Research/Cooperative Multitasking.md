> **Cooperative multitasking**, also known as **non-preemptive multitasking**, is a style of [computer multitasking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_multitasking 'Computer multitasking') in which the [operating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system 'Operating system') never initiates a [context switch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context_switch 'Context switch') from a running [process](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_(computing)> 'Process (computing)') to another process. Instead, to run multiple applications concurrently, processes voluntarily [yield control](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yield_(multithreading)> 'Yield (multithreading)') periodically or when idle or logically [blocked](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blocking_(computing)> 'Blocking (computing)'). This type of multitasking is called _cooperative_ because all programs must cooperate for the scheduling scheme to work.
