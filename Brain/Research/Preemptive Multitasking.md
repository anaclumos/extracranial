> Preemptive multitasking involves the use of an interrupt mechanism, which suspends the currently executing process and invokes a scheduler to determine which process should execute next. Therefore, all processes will get some CPU time at any given time. [Preemption (computing)](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preemption_(computing)#PREEMPTIVE>)

Antonym of [[Cooperative Multitasking]].
