> In [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science 'Computer science'), **multiple buffering** is the use of more than one [buffer](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffer_(computer_science)> 'Buffer (computer science)') to hold a block of data, so that a "reader" will see a complete (though perhaps old) version of the data, rather than a partially updated version of the data being created by a ["writer"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Readers-writers_problem 'Readers-writers problem'). [Multiple buffering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_buffering).

Used in [[Game Programming]], you write data on the back buffer.
When the rendering is complete, you swap it with the front buffer.
