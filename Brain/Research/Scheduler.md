> A job scheduler is a computer application for controlling unattended background program execution of jobs. This is commonly called batch scheduling, as the execution of non-interactive jobs is often called batch processing, though traditional job and batch are distinguished and contrasted; see that page for details. Other synonyms include batch system, distributed resource management system (DRMS), distributed resource manager (DRM), and, commonly today, workload automation (WLA). The data structure of jobs to run is known as the job queue. [Job scheduler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Job_scheduler)
