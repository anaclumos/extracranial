> A **job scheduler** is a computer application for controlling unattended background program execution of [jobs](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Job_(computing)> 'Job (computing)'). This is commonly called **batch scheduling**, as the execution of non-interactive jobs is often called [batch processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batch_processing 'Batch processing'), though traditional _job_ and _batch_ are distinguished and contrasted; see that page for details. Other synonyms include **batch system**, **distributed resource management system** (**DRMS**), **distributed resource manager** (**DRM**), and, commonly today, **workload automation** (**WLA**). The data structure of jobs to run is known as the [job queue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Job_queue 'Job queue'). [Job scheduler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Job_scheduler)
