# Metaverse

> In [futurism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futurism 'Futurism') and [science fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction 'Science fiction'), the **metaverse** is a hypothetical iteration of the [Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet 'Internet') as a single, universal and immersive [virtual world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_world 'Virtual world') that is facilitated by the use of [virtual reality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality 'Virtual reality') (VR) and [augmented reality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_reality 'Augmented reality') (AR) headsets. In everyday use, a metaverse is a network of 3D [virtual worlds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_world 'Virtual world') focused on social connection.

It has now come to my mind that Metaverse can be attained within years with [[Prompt Engineering]].
