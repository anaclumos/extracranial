# Metaverse

> In futurism and science fiction, the metaverse is a hypothetical iteration of the Internet as a single, universal and immersive virtual world that is facilitated by the use of virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) headsets. In everyday use, a metaverse is a network of 3D virtual worlds focused on social connection. [Metaverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaverse)

It has now come to my mind that Metaverse can be attained within years with [[Prompt Engineering]].
