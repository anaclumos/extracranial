# Shim

> In [computer programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming 'Computer programming'), a **shim** is a [library](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_(computer_science)> 'Library (computer science)') that [transparently](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_(human%E2%80%93computer_interaction)> 'Transparency (human-computer interaction)') intercepts [API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface 'Application programming interface') calls and changes the arguments passed, handles the operation itself or redirects the operation elsewhere. Shims can be used to support an old API in a newer environment or a new API in an older environment. Shims can also be used to run programs on different software platforms than were developed for.
