An idea suggested on [[2022-07-14]] that all inventions should be _fiercely overpriced_.

To attain [[FIRE]], we have previously explored that [[SaaS]] would be one way to go.
However, good _engineering_ and a good _product_ are very different.
One major roadblock would be the lack of expertise in payment infra.
What if we start from a _simple_ yet _overpriced_ [[SaaS]] product to test how to get monetized?
The purpose is not to generate revenue by itself but to examine and get enough data out on how the real-world [[SaaS]] [[FIRE]] will work out.

**Examples**.
A book recommendation web app but _you need to pay to use it_.
[[Metadata as a Service]] could also be one example.
