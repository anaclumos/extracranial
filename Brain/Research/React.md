> **React** (also known as **React.js** or **ReactJS**) is a [free and open-source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software 'Free and open-source software') [front-end](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_end_and_back_end 'Front end and back end') [JavaScript library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript_library 'JavaScript library') for building [user interfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interfaces 'User interfaces') based on UI [components](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component-based_software_engineering 'Component-based software engineering'). It is maintained by [Meta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms 'Meta Platforms') (formerly Facebook) and a community of individual developers and companies. React can be used as a base in the development of [single-page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application 'Single-page application'), mobile, or server-rendered applications with frameworks like [Next.js](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Next.js 'Next.js'). However, React is only concerned with state management and rendering that state to the [DOM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model 'Document Object Model'), so creating React applications usually requires the use of additional libraries for routing, as well as certain client-side functionality.
