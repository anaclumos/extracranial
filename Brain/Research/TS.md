It is a strict syntactical [superset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superset 'Superset') of [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript 'JavaScript') and adds optional [static typing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_typing 'Static typing') to the language. It is designed for the development of large applications and [transpiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source-to-source_compiler 'Source-to-source compiler') to JavaScript. As it is a superset of JavaScript, existing JavaScript programs are also valid TypeScript programs. [TypeScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TypeScript)
