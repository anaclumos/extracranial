> Consider a future device … in which an individual stores all his books, records, and communications, which is mechanized so that it may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility. It is an enlarged intimate supplement to his memory. [As We May Think - The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/)

> In "As We May Think", [[Vannevar Bush]] describes a memex as an electromechanical device enabling individuals to develop and read a large self-contained research library, create and follow associative trails of links and personal annotations, and recall these trails at any time to share them with other researchers. This device would closely mimic the associative processes of the human mind, but it would be gifted with permanent recollection. As Bush writes, "Thus science may implement how man produces, stores, and consults the record of the race". [Memex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memex)

- Synonym with [[extracranial]], Digital Brain, Second Brain, etc.
