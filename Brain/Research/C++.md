> **C++** (pronounced "C plus plus") is a [general-purpose programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General-purpose_programming_language 'General-purpose programming language') created by Danish computer scientist [Bjarne Stroustrup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bjarne_Stroustrup 'Bjarne Stroustrup') as an extension of the [C programming language](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)> 'C (programming language)'), or "C with [Classes](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(programming)> 'Class (programming)')". The language has expanded significantly over time, and modern C++ now has [object-oriented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming 'Object-oriented programming'), [generic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generic_programming 'Generic programming'), and [functional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming 'Functional programming') features in addition to facilities for [low-level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-level_programming_language 'Low-level programming language') [memory](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_(computing)> 'Memory (computing)') manipulation. It is almost always implemented as a [compiled language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiled_language 'Compiled language'), and many vendors provide [C++ compilers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_compilers#C.2B.2B_compilers 'List of compilers'), including the [Free Software Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation 'Free Software Foundation'), [LLVM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LLVM 'LLVM'), [Microsoft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft 'Microsoft'), [Intel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel 'Intel'), [Embarcadero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embarcadero_Technologies 'Embarcadero Technologies'), [Oracle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Developer_Studio 'Oracle Developer Studio'), and [IBM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM 'IBM'), so it is available on many platforms.
