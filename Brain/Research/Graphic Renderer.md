> **Rendering** or **image synthesis** is the process of generating a [photorealistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physically-based_rendering 'Physically-based rendering') or [non-photorealistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-photorealistic_rendering 'Non-photorealistic rendering') image from a [2D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2D_model '2D model') or [3D model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_model '3D model') by means of a [computer program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program 'Computer program'). The resulting image is referred to as the **render**. Multiple models can be defined in a _scene file_ containing objects in a strictly defined language or [data structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure 'Data structure'). The scene file contains geometry, viewpoint, [texture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texture_mapping 'Texture mapping'), [lighting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_graphics_lighting 'Computer graphics lighting'), and [shading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shading 'Shading') information describing the virtual scene. The data contained in the scene file is then passed to a rendering program to be processed and output to a [digital image](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_image 'Digital image') or [raster graphics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raster_graphics 'Raster graphics') image file. The term "rendering" is analogous to the concept of an [artist's impression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artist%27s_impression "Artist's impression") of a scene. The term "rendering" is also used to describe the process of calculating effects in a video editing program to produce the final video output.
