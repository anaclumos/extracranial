# GDPR

> The **General Data Protection Regulation** (EU) (**GDPR**) is a [regulation](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_(European_Union)> 'Regulation (European Union)') in [EU law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EU_law 'EU law') on [data protection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_protection 'Data protection') and privacy in the [European Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union 'European Union') (EU) and the [European Economic Area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Economic_Area 'European Economic Area') (EEA). The GDPR is an important component of EU [privacy law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_law 'Privacy law') and of [human rights law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights_law 'Human rights law'), in particular Article 8(1) of the [Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charter_of_Fundamental_Rights_of_the_European_Union 'Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union'). It also addresses the transfer of [personal data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_data 'Personal data') outside the EU and EEA areas. The GDPR's primary aim is to enhance individuals' control and rights over their personal data and to simplify the regulatory environment for [international business](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_business 'International business'). Superseding the [Data Protection Directive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Protection_Directive 'Data Protection Directive') 95/46/EC, the regulation contains provisions and requirements related to the processing of [personal data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_data 'Personal data') of individuals (formally called _data subjects_ in the GDPR) who are located in the EEA, and applies to any enterprise—regardless of its location and the data subjects' citizenship or residence—that is processing the personal information of individuals inside the EEA.
