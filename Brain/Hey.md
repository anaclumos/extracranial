Welcome to my research note.
I grew up reading [The Encyclopedia of Absolute and Relative Knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%27Encyclop%C3%A9die_du_savoir_relatif_et_absolu) and envisioned a _single source of truth_ just like it that integrated my projects and research.

If you are familiar with such concepts, this place is also a [[Memex]].

You will find my most up-to-date interests here.
I write in English and Korean and don't plan to translate the notes.
If you seek internationalized content, check out my [articles](/w/archive).

## Basics

- Avoid deep folder structures
- Avoid data pile
  - Rewrite & Compress
  - [[Building a Second Brain|BASB]] recommends compressing 50x
- Use [[Inliner]]

## Tech Stacks

I use [[Obsidian]] for taking notes.
I then then pipeline those notes into a heavily customized [[TypeScript]] [[Docusaurus]] with custom [[React]] components.
I finally finally use [[Vercel]] for deploying, caching, and distributing.

I open-sourced it on [GitHub](https://github.com/anaclumos/extracranial).
Take a look! 😃
