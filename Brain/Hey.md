Welcome to my [[research]] note.
I extensively studied [[PKM]]s and envisioned a _single source of truth_ that integrated my projects and research.
You will find my most up-to-date interests here.
I write in English and Korean and don't plan to translate the notes.
If you seek internationalized content, check out my [articles](/w/archive).

- Avoid deep folder structures.
- Avoid data pile
  - Rewrite & Compress.
  - [[Building a Second Brain|BASB]] recommends compressing 50x.
- [[Inliner]]

## Tech Stacks

I use [[Obsidian]] for taking notes.
I pipeline those notes into a heavily customized [[TS]] [[Docusaurus]] with custom [[React]] components.
I use [[Vercel]] for deploying (SSR) and [[Cloudflare]] CDN for caching and distributing.
Finally, I open-sourced it on [GitHub](https://github.com/anaclumos/extracranial), so take a look.
