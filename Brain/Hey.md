Welcome to my research note.
I grew up reading [The Encyclopedia of Absolute and Relative Knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%27Encyclop%C3%A9die_du_savoir_relatif_et_absolu) and envisioned a _single source of truth_ just like it that integrated my projects and research.
I am very happy to present you the incarnation of this vision.
You will find my most up-to-date interests here.
I write in English and Korean and don't plan to translate the notes.
That said, I am also a huge fan of Computational Linguistics, so I want to try automating translations one day.
But nothing special today.
If you seek internationalized content, check out my [articles](/w/archive).

If you are familiar with such concepts, this place is also a [[Memex]] or a Digital Graden.
Unlike traditional blogs or notes, this is a non-linear space.
That is, there are no predefined categories or tags; no sequential order; and minimal hierarchy.
Therefore you can randomly pick a note and follow the links to other notes.
Every note will be [[evergreen notes]], interrelating with other notes,
illustrating the connections between ideas, thus capturing the bigger picture.

## Basics

- Avoid deep folder structures
- Avoid data pile
  - Rewrite & Compress
  - [[Building a Second Brain|BASB]] recommends compressing 50x
- Use [[Inliner]]

## Tech Stacks

I use [[Obsidian]] for taking notes.
I then then pipeline those notes into a heavily customized [[TypeScript]] [[Docusaurus]] with custom [[React]] components.
I finally use [[Vercel]] for deploying, caching, and distributing.

I open-sourced it on [GitHub](https://github.com/anaclumos/extracranial).
Take a look! 😃
