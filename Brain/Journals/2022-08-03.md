## Work Research

Replaced Terser with ESBuild.
Improved build speed by 81%!
Knowing that Terser does slightly more optimization under the hood, we can imagine a build flow where we use ESBuild for developer build and Terser for Production builds.

Also, I succeeded on fooling `getBoundingClientRect()` on top of [[WorkerDOM]].
This happens synchronously using [[Atomics]] and [[SharedArrayBuffer]].
For the next and final step of my internship, I will containerize React Flip Toolkit on top of [[WorkerDOM]] using the same technique.
