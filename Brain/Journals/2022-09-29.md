### [Dub - Open-Source Bitly Alternative](https://dub.sh/)

- [Steven Tey: "Introducing my new side project: https://t.co/BGR54GVVRK It's an open-source link-shortener SaaS with built-in analytics + free custom domains 🚀 Built with ▲ @Vercel Edge Functions + @Upstash Redis"](https://twitter.com/steventey/status/1572958186667233282)
- Built with Vercel Edge Functions + Upstash Redis
- I built a dashboard to visualize the time-series data for each link's clicks (incl. location, device/os) with [airbnb/visx: 🐯 visx | visualization components](https://github.com/airbnb/visx)
- You can use your own domain for your links (e.g. http://stey.me/devrel) even on free plans This is made possible by the Platforms Starter Kit that I launched at Vercel earlier this year: [vercel/platforms: A template for site builders and low-code tools.](https://github.com/vercel/platforms)
  - [[nextjs]] framework
  - vercel hosting
  - tailwindcss CSS
  - upstash database
  - nextauthjs
  - framer animations
  - stripe payments
- AGPLv3 license: you can clone, modify, and even deploy your own instance of Dub, as long as you open-source it.
