- [[Super App and Democracy]]
- Instead of listing everything on a Journal Page, I should start separating them into individual [[Research]] pages.
- I am unsure if I would backdate to migrate them.

## [[TODO]]

- [ ] [[How is WASM cross-platform]]
- [ ] Study the thread by [Shu](https://twitter.com/shuding_/status/1579607964549513217).
