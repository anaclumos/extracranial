# 2022-10-11

- Instead of listing everything on a Journal Page, I should start separating them into individual [[Research]] pages.
- I am unsure if I would backdate to migrate them.
- Had trouble setting HomePod with Wi-Fi. The problem was because of using WPA3 Personal. I switched to WPA2 Personal, and it worked like a charm.

## [[TODO]]

- [ ] [[How is WASM cross-platform when ASM is not]]
- [ ] Study the thread: [Shu: "Some tech details and stories behind @vercel's OG image generation and Satori lib"](https://twitter.com/shuding_/status/1579607964549513217). We might want to dissect this.
- [ ] Convert [[Hacker News|HN]], [daily.dev](https://app.daily.dev/), Surfit.io into Linker Service Case Study

## Personal Research

- [[Satori]]
- [[Super App and Democracy]]
