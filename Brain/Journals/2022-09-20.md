## [[Coding Tests]]

## Personal Research

- [[How is WebAssembly cross-platform when Assembly is not]]

### [It's Just a Tarball](https://matt-rickard.ghost.io/its-just-a-tarball/)

- _Yet, container images are just tarballs_
- _Yet Git's object model is pretty simple - content-addressed blobs (file-like), trees (folder-like), and commits that get stored in a `.git/objects` folder_
- _Some `git` commands are still just shell scripts under the hood_
- _Not to mention [plaintext protocols](https://matt-rickard.com/the-power-of-plaintext-protocols). HTTP, SMTP, FTP, and Redis Serialization Protocol (RESP) are a few examples_
- _Maybe one caveat is that nascent technology is often unnecessarily complex. Things are just getting pieced together - unoptimized workflows, artifacts leftover from failed experiments_
- Very inspiring read.

- Mock interview: Interviewer should present a question only.
