## Personal Research

- Writing with an iPad helps thinking.
- I am using [Prodrafts](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/prodrafts/id1545810067), but it has limits:
  - 👍 Infinite canvas
  - 👍 Native PencilKit support
  - 👍 Apple-ish design language
  - 👎 Unable to construct Zettlekasten
    - No graphing
    - No backlinking
    - No referencing.
  - 👎 Poor i18n support (originally targeted for Chinese users.)
- Given this, [simonbs/InfiniteCanvas: Infinite canvas using PencilKit](https://github.com/simonbs/InfiniteCanvas), it seems relatively easy to convert this into a full-blown [[FIRE Engine]].
- Will add this note to [[Intracranials]].
