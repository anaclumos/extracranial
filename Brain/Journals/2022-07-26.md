## Personal Research

- Writing with an iPad helps thinking.
- I am using Prodrafts, but it has limits:
  - 👍 infinite canvas, native PencilKit support, Apple-ish design language
  - 👎 unable to construct Zettlekasten. No graphing, no backlinking, no referencing.
  - 👎👎 poor i18n support (originally targeted for Chinese users.)
- Given this, [simonbs/InfiniteCanvas: Infinite canvas using PencilKit](https://github.com/simonbs/InfiniteCanvas), it seems relatively easy to convert this into a full-blown [[FIRE Engine]].
- Will add this note to [[Intracranials]].
