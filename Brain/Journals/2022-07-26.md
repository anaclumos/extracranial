## Personal Research

### [[Intracranials]]

- Writing with an iPad helps thinking.
- I am using [Prodrafts](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/prodrafts/id1545810067), but it has limits:
  - 👍 Infinite canvas
  - 👍 Native PencilKit support
  - 👍 Apple-ish design language
  - 👎 Unable to construct Zettlekasten
    - 👎 No graphing
    - 👎 No backlinking
    - 👎 No referencing
  - 👎 Poor i18n support (initially targeted for Chinese users.)
    - 👎 Significant portion is untranslated
- Given this, [simonbs/InfiniteCanvas: Infinite canvas using PencilKit](https://github.com/simonbs/InfiniteCanvas), it seems relatively easy to convert this into a full-blown [[FIRE Engine]].
- Will add this note to [[Intracranials]].

## Today's [[Hacker News]]

### [More invested in nuclear fusion in last 12 months than past decade](https://www.growthbusiness.co.uk/more-invested-in-nuclear-fusion-in-last-12-months-than-past-decade-2560528/)

- _The clean energy solution has attracted about $2.8bn (£2.5bn) in global investment over the past year, compared with $1.9bn (£1.6bn) over the past decade_.

* _There was also a breakthrough in late 2021 when researchers at the Joint European Torus (JET) facility in Oxford released a record-breaking 59 megajoules of fusion – almost tripling the previous 21.7-megajoule record from 1997_.

### [The tar archive format, its extensions, and why GNU tar extracts in quadratic time - Mort's Ramblings](https://mort.coffee/home/tar/)

- _That means, every time GNU tar wants to create a hard link, it first has to walk the entire linked list of delayed links and see if the target is a delayed link. The new link must also be delayed if the target is a delayed link._
- _Your time complexity alarm bells should be starting to ring now. For every hard link, we walk the list of all delayed links. But it gets worse; for reasons I don't quite understand yet, tar will go through the entire list of delayed links again if it finds out that it can create the connection immediately. So, all "normal" hard links must go through the entire linked list of delayed links twice._
