## Today's [[Hacker News]]

### [Why an ‘everything app’ is bad news for liberal democracies and free markets - Nitin, you can't be serious!](https://www.nitinpai.in/2022/10/10/why-an-everything-app-is-bad-news-for-liberal-democracies-and-free-markets)

- _Many technology entrepreneurs dream of an "Everything App", a smartphone application that will deliver everything to everyone on the planet._
- _Elon Musk has become the latest investor [to declare an ambition](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-10-04/musk-says-buying-twitter-speeds-up-creating-an-everything-app) to build such a super-app wanting to emulate the success of WeChat, a Chinese super-app._
- _The Everything app presents massive risks to personal, economic, and political freedom._
- _As [John Gruber of Daring Fireball](https://daringfireball.net/2022/10/everything) says, “It’s no coincidence at all that WeChat is the only “everything app” anyone can cite, and it comes from China, an authoritarian regime._
- _It doesn’t benefit users that WeChat dominates all aspects of digital life . It helps the authoritarian Chinese Communist Party._
- _The user is socially locked into a ‘private’ company for performing any or all socio-economic functions._
- _Public policy must act to prevent firms and apps from acquiring socioeconomic dominance in the first place_
  - Nurture a competitive market.
  - Promote open public digital infrastructure with interoperability.
- _At a deeper level, Musk’s desire to emulate the Chinese model alerts us to the danger of the interests of Big Tech increasingly diverging from those of liberal democracies._
- _Preserving our freedom may indeed be their most important corporate social responsibility._

### [Improving Firefox responsiveness on macOS - Mozilla Hacks - the Web developer blog](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2022/10/improving-firefox-responsiveness-on-macos/)

- _This improvement was achieved via a slight change in how locking is implemented within Firefox's memory allocator._
- _Putting a thread to sleep has significant performance implications and, thus, is not always the best option._
- _it might be advantageous to let a thread spin briefly if the lock it's trying to acquire is only held for a brief period._
- _It can result in higher performance and lower power consumption as spinning costs less than sleeping._
- _As you might have guessed by now, `OSSpinLock` offered excellent performance on a lightly loaded system but behaved poorly as the load ramped up._
- _This problem with `OSSpinLock` was [known](https://mjtsai.com/blog/2015/12/16/osspinlock-is-unsafe/) within [Apple](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-dev/Week-of-Mon-20151214/000372.html) hence its deprecation_
- _Enter [`os_unfair_lock`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/os/os_unfair_lock), Apple's official replacement for `OSSpinLock`. If you still use `OSSpinLock`, you'll get explicit warnings to use it instead_
- _So I used it, but the results were terrible. Performance in some of our automated tests [degraded by as much as 30%](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1774458)._
- _As it turns out, `os_unfair_lock` doesn't spin on contention; it makes the calling thread [sleep right away when it finds a contended lock](https://github.com/apple/darwin-libplatform/blob/215b09856ab5765b7462a91be7076183076600df/src/os/lock.c#L536)_
- _The function is [`os_unfair_lock_with_options()`](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/6ec440e105c2b75d5cae9d34f957a2f85a106d54/memory/build/Mutex.h#22-34) and the options I used are `OS_UNFAIR_LOCK_DATA_SYNCHRONIZATION` and `OS_UNFAIR_LOCK_ADAPTIVE_SPIN`_
- _The latter asks the kernel to use kernel-space adaptive spinning, and the former prevents it from spawning additional threads in the thread pools used by Apple's libraries_
- _Did they work? Yes! Performance on lightly loaded systems was about the same as `OSSpinLock`, but on loaded ones, they provided massively better responsiveness_
- _As an intermediate solution, I initially fell back to `OSSpinLock` on older systems. Later I managed to get rid of it for good by relying on `os_unfair_lock` plus [manual spinning in user space](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1784018)_

### [why 23.976 and not 24 fps?? - AC's & DIT's - Cinematography.com](https://cinematography.com/index.php?/forums/topic/71346-why-23976-and-not-24-fps/&tab=comments#comment-455454)

- _Due to limitations of frequency divider circuits when the color standard was promulgated, the color subcarrier frequency was constructed as composite frequency assembled from small integers, in this case, 5×7×9/(8×11) MHz.\[7\] The horizontal line rate was reduced to approximately 15,734 lines per second (3.579545×2/455 MHz) from 15,750 lines per second, and the frame rate was reduced to about 29.970 frames per second (the horizontal line rate divided by 525 lines/frame) from 30 frames per second. These changes amounted to 0.1 percent and were readily tolerated by existing television receivers_
- _So throughout the 2000s, the main reason you shot at 23.976 fps instead of 24P was audio post in the U.S._
- _Even movies shot at true 24 fps had to deal with this because a telecine transfer to NTSC for dailies and NLE post changed the frame rate to 23.976 fps, so the frame rate didn't get restored to 24 fps until the movie was finished to film and projected at 24 fps. So after a movie was edited offline, tape copies were sent to sound post for cutting and mixing sound, so they were working with material running at 23.976 fps whether or not it was shot at 24 fps or 23.976 fps_
