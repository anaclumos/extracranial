### [After self-hosting my email for twenty-three years I have thrown in the towel. The oligopoly has won.](https://cfenollosa.com/blog/after-self-hosting-my-email-for-twenty-three-years-i-have-thrown-in-the-towel-the-oligopoly-has-won.html)

- Email is now an oligopoly, a service gatekept by a few big companies, which does not follow the principles of net neutrality.
- Google has half a billion results for "[my email goes directly to spam](https://www.google.com/search?q=my+email+goes+directly+to+spam)
- email servers run bayesian filtering algorithms which protect you, and most spam doesn't reach your inbox.
- Email deliverability is deliberately nerfed by Big Tech.
- if you want to build services on top of the email, you have to pay for an email sending API which has been blessed by others in the industry. One of **them**.

### [Self-Hosted email is the hardest it's ever been, but also the easiest.](https://vadosware.io/post/its-never-been-easier-or-harder-to-self-host-email/)

- Deliverability may be troubled, but the act of running your email server has never been easier. Struggling with `postfix` and `dovecot` configuration, semantics, and architecture isn’t the only way to start using the email you control.
- You don’t have to `postfix` + `dovecot` in 2022.
- An excellent recommendation from the original discussion on [[Hacker News|HN]] was to use [ImprovMX](https://improvmx.com) as an outgoing email server.
