## Personal Research

### Explored [[SwiftUI]].

1. I Love the declarative interface.
2. It Feels like using React (or even better.)
3. Xcode is still heavy.
4. Happy to quit fiddling with Storyboard. Every change happens in code but in a declarative way. Huge fan.
5. Creating a component-based view is easier than ever.

Will continue to explore.

### [[Optimistic Nihilism]]

_Optimistic nihilism views the belief that there is no underlying meaning to life from a perspective of hope. It's not that we're doomed to live in a meaningless universeâ€“it's that we get the chance to experience ourselves and the universe we share._
