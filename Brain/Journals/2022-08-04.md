## Personal Research

Explored [[SwiftUI]].

1. I Love the declarative interface.
2. It Feels like using React (or even better.)
3. Xcode is still heavy.
4. Happy to quit fiddling with Storyboard. Every change happens in code but in a declarative way. Huge fan.
5. Creating a component-based view is easier than ever.

Will continue to explore.
