## Personal Notes

- [[PARA]]... might be worse than I thought?
  - The structure is unintuitive and redundant.
  - I might come up with my own structure.
  - Current idea: `Projects`, `Research`, `Readings`, `Journals`.
- contact mail and signup mail -- separation necessary?
- Merged! ![[1F98FE.jpeg]]
- A successful business sells lifestyles and dreams. Did they succeed by selling a dream, or did they rebrand themselves when they got enough cash?

## Work Notes

### [[Brane]]

- Decided with `two-roots.` Locally confirmed it operates correctly.

![Confirmed that two WorkerDOM threads and one main thread appear.](0AE02B.png)

- One thing to confirm: `two-roots` uses `getBoundingClientRectAsync`

![The above redundancy is for different browser supports for `module`.)](0D50A5.png)

### [[Brane]] [[WorkerDOM]] Non-blocking Example

![](044014.png)

- Implemented the Technical Proof of Concept and posted here: _PoC that two [[WorkerDOM]] upgraded threads don't block each other_ - [Two Roots](https://brane.vercel.app/two-roots-with-infinite-loop/)

1.  Open Dev Console.
2.  Press Health Check in both Root 1 and Root 2.
3.  Check that both are alive.
4.  After pressing "while(true)" in Root 1, only Root 2 will respond.
