## Work Research

### Preparing Data Transmission

- [x] Inside [[Web Worker]] Thread `MutationTransfer.ts`, create a `transferSync` layer.
- [x] Add a key `TransferrableKeys.synchronous`.

### Transmitting Data

Whenever we need a synchronous operation,

- [x] Allocate a [[SharedArrayBuffer]] inside `transferSync`.
- [ ] Run `Atomic.wait()` at the main thread.
- [ ] Run the calculation at the corresponding processor on the main thread.
- [ ] Pass the data into the received [[SharedArrayBuffer]].
- [ ] Unfreeze the [[Web Worker]] thread with `Atomic.notify()`.
