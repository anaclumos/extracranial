### [Screenshots as the Universal API](https://matt-rickard.ghost.io/screenshots-as-the-universal-api/?ref=Matt+Rickard-newsletter)

- With ML advancements, screenshots are now a universal data format.
  - (decoder) relatively easy to extract...
    - meaning (image-to-text)
    - layout information (object recognition)
    - text ([[OCR]])
    - other metadata (formatting, fonts, etc.)
  - (encoder) diffusion-based models like Stable Diffusion and DALL-E (text-to-image) [[Prompt Engineering]]
- What's good:
  - Easier to parse than highly complex layout formats
    - No need to understand PDF data format
    - No need to hydrate webs for web crawlers
  - Universally available, easily copyable
    - Images aren't the most efficient encoding method for text.
    - But they can be the simplest for humans
    - You can copy objects from photos in the latest [[Apple]] iOS 16 update.
- Permissionless.
  - Many applications won't allow you to export data.
  - Screenshots are always available.
  - Related to when [[Naver]] Vibe attempted to steal other music players' market cap with Screenshot Recognition technology.

- More complex metadata
  - Look how effective image search is on mobile. Dogs, City, Oceans...
  - Some come from the actual image metadata, others inferred with on-device models.
  - Automatically encoding this data in traditional formats like PDF takes much longer.
- I wrote a reply like the following.

Dear Mr. Rickard,

Awesome article. I want to give one good example of Screenshots-as-an-API.

Unlike the Western market, the Korean music market is heavily independent. Although YouTube Music has gobbled up the market cap quite significantly, most people still use Korean services to listen to music, primarily due to copyright issues for foreign Music services (they don't have Korean songs). That being said, Spotify and Apple Music have a market penetration of next to nothing.

There are two behemoths in Korea, Naver, and Kakao. Naver services as the omnipotent search engine for Korea (bigger market cap than Google Korea) and Kakao services as an almighty chatting app (more than 95% of Koreans use it). They always fight each other for market superiority.

Kakao currently operates the #1 music streaming service, Melon. In 2019, Naver released a new music streaming service, Vibe, akin to Spotify in terms of interface and functionality. At the time, Melon had a notorious lock-in for music playlists to deter users from escaping to other platforms. Melon had no APIs, SSOs, or Access Tokens, not to mention prohibiting all sorts of copy-paste and data extraction.

Naver eventually released a feature where users could screenshot the playlist to port out playlists from melon. It was a clever move that did not violate any law restrictions or terms of use. I attached a translated article and video for you. The video is in Korean, but it's a 30-second visual tutorial video, so you'll get the feeling.

The Korean tech market has these random unheard intriguing stories. I'm at @anaclumos on GitHub, Twitter, and any other platform. Hope we can keep in touch.

### [Rethinking the PDF](https://matt-rickard.com/rethinking-the-pdf)

- It's founder, John Warnock (co-founder of Adobe), prototyped a compatibility layer where documents would look and, most importantly, print (!) the same regardless of the computer they were viewed on ([1993 video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRrpyY8KPWE). _This is the [[PDF]]._
- The "killer app" for PDF was tax returns – the [[IRS]] adopted PDF in 1996 because of a rumored frustration with the US Postal Service.
- Things that lack:
  - Enterprise-grade [[OCR]] for [[PDF]] documents still doesn't exist in 2022, albeit having state-of-the-art computer vision techniques.
  - Interactive and web-enabled forms. Sometimes it saves without the data filled in
  - Slow page loads. Better alternatives: [[epub]], [[mobi]] for texts. For generic use cases, [[DjVu]].
