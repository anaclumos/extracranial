## [[Brane]] Notes

In easy words, [[Brane]] is about making a pseudo-ATM.
First, make a giant [[JS]] object.
This giant object has lots of APIs which look exactly like [[DOM]] APIs.
Give this object to a [[Worker]] which includes third-party codes.

Client = Third-party codes.

### Progress
- Used `debug/main.js` to find `console` printouts.

### Naïve plan — Drop-and-Replace `postMessage`

What if we drop-and-replace `postMessage` with `postViaSab`?
Make `postViaSab` that follows the same interface as `postMessage` but is internally made with [[SharedArrayBuffer]].
Wouldn't this yield much higher throughput? (No, it wouldn't.)

### Shortcomings of [[SharedArrayBuffer]]
- **Fixed in Size**
- **Thread-Unsafe**
- **Synchronous**

[[Brane]] requires explicit **schedulers** and **abstractions** to overcome these shortcomings.
Drop-and-replace will not be that easy.
But what do I mean by this?

### Schedulers
Currently, [[WorkerDOM]] only has asynchronous data channels.
[[WorkerDOM]] batch processes requests between agents (i.e., it collects operations and sends them at once.)
[[WorkerDOM]] will have scheduler support for general tasks, extended tasks, etc.
What kinds of data channels does [[WorkerDOM]] have?

> Would it be efficient to change all asynchronous data channels to synchronous [[SharedArrayBuffer]]?

In easy words, [[Brane]] implements a premium-tier [[SharedArrayBuffer]] fast lane that will handle priority tasks.
Note that it might block user interaction because [[SharedArrayBuffer]] is synchronous. This is why we need a proper ***scheduler***.

:::info
Priority: ① User Interaction ② Layout Operations ③ Other Operations
:::

### Abstractions

The reason for such [[SharedArrayBuffer]] is to eradicate any compatibility issues.
For example, one incompatible operation is `Element.prototype.getClientBoundingRect()`.
Animation in [[JS]] requires synchronous layout calculation because it depends on values that could only be found after [[DOM Reflow]].
This calculation *must* process in a blocking condition.
This blocking condition *must* happen in SharedArrayBuffer.
[[WorkerDOM]] cannot handle animation libraries because it lacks synchronous API support.

We aim to build [[Cooperative Multitasking]].
However, a guest app should look as [[Preemptive Multitasking]] as if blocking APIs blocks a thread.
Blocking in [[JS]] can be done in two ways.
[[Brane]] should use either of the above to attain [[Cooperative Multitasking]].

1. **Synchronous XMLHttpRequest.**
2. **[[Atomics]] API.** Use `wait()` and `notify()` for blocking constructs.

To automatically use [[Atomics]] API for every third-party app, [[Brane]] should ***abstract*** this process.

### Final Goal
- Replace all unofficial implementation of `getClientBoundingRect` in [[WorkerDOM]] with `Element.prototype.getClientBoundingRect()`.
- Geolocation *might* be easier, because it is an asynchronous API.
- The hard part is transports and schedulers.

### Codecs
We will need a codec to share data on [[SharedArrayBuffer]].
Candidates include [[MessagePack]] and [[CBOR]].
We could also make our codec.

### Tomorrow
- How did the scope change from the goal?
- What is possible and what is impossible?
