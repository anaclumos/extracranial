### [Use.GPU Docs - Intro](https://usegpu.live/)

- Use.GPU is a set of **declarative, reactive WebGPU legos**. Compose live graphs, layouts, meshes, and shaders, on the fly
- It's a **stand-alone [[Typescript]]+Rust/WASM library** with its own React-like run-time. If you're familiar with React, you will feel right at home
- It has a built-in **shader linker and binding generator**, which means a lot of the tedium of common GPU programming is eliminated without compromising on flexibility
