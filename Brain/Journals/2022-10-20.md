### [EasyList is in trouble, and so are many ad blockers](https://adguard.com/en/blog/easylist-filter-problem-help.html)

1.  There’s an [open-source Android browser](https://github.com/hazuki0x0/YuzuBrowser) (now seemingly abandoned) that implements ad-blocking functionality.
2.  This browser is forked by a couple of other browsers that are very popular in India.
3.  The problem is that this browser has a severe flaw. It tries to download filter updates on **every startup**, and on Android, it may happen many times daily. It can even happen when the browser is running in the background.
