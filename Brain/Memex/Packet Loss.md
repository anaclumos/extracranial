- When does packet loss happen?
- For a router, when incoming bytes overwhelm the outgoing bytes, the router must keep the unsent queued data in the memory.
- If the memory runs out, some of the newly arrived incoming packets will be lost.
- Alternative: circuit switching.
  - router A and B have multiple lines and use one cable for one communication.
- packet switching allows more users to use the network
