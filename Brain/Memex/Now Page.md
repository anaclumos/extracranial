### [about nownownow.com](https://nownownow.com/about):

- So, a website with a link that says “now” goes to a page that tells you what this person is focused on at this point in their life. For short, we call it a “now page”.
- Like, “Still living in Dallas, though considering moving to Austin. Working at ABC. Getting into cycling. The kids are ages 3 and 6. I’m reading a lot of Pema Chödrön and listening to a lot of jazz piano, especially Brad Mehldau. I’ve stopped taking on web design clients since I’d rather keep improving my back-end database work.”
- That’s what a now page is for. You can’t get that big picture from any other outlets I’m aware of.
