> Web typography refers to using fonts on the World Wide Web. When HTML was first created, [[font]] faces and styles were controlled exclusively by the settings of each web browser. There was no mechanism for individual Web pages to control [[font]] display until Netscape introduced the [[font]] element in 1995, which was then standardized in the HTML 3.2 specification. However, the [[font]] specified by the [[font]] element had to be installed on the user's computer, or a fallback [[font]], such as a browser's default sans-serif or monospace [[font]], would be used. The first Cascading Style Sheets specification was published in 1996 and provided the same capabilities. [Web typography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_typography)
