One radical idea that uses classic blogging services is a Second Brain...
- Write everything as small chunks of notes (Posts.)
- Let Algolia Web indexing do all of the interlinkings.
- You *search* this custom Algolia indices to pull up whatever you want to think "interlinkedly."
- Basically, just give up linking things.
