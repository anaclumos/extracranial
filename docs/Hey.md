## Intro

This is my research note. I have extensively studied the topic of PKM and envisioned an online _source of truth_ that firmly integrated my projects and research. Here, you will find books I'm reading, articles I'm analyzing, and topics that grasped my interest.

This section will consist of English and Korean notes unless I randomly decide to learn a new language. I do not intend to translate the notes, considering the scale.

## Key Ideas

> What does moving from mindless consumption to mindful creation look like? — Forte, _Building a Second Brain_

> _It’s hard to write notes that are worth developing over time. These principles help: ① Evergreen notes should be atomic ② Evergreen notes should be concept-oriented ③ Evergreen notes should be densely linked ④ Prefer associative ontologies to hierarchical taxonomies ⑤ Write notes for yourself by default, disregarding audience. This concept is of course enormously indebted to the notion of a Zettelkasten. See Similarities and differences between evergreen note-writing and Zettelkasten. _ - [Andy Matuschak](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes)

## Basic Rules for Note-taking

This PKM will _not_ follow outliner UX. I believe in the potential of freeform text that flows. Also, I plan on constructing a PKM closer to Britannica rather than Wikipedia — make each note like a case study entry rather than an encyclopedia entry upfront.

- ASAP: **_As Short As Possible._**
- Keep the note Loosely folder-ed.
  - For personal use-case, I'd suggest simply putting the entire content into one mega folder.
  - assets, books, journals, notes...
- Do not make a data pile.
  - All content should retain its brevity.
  - I need to review them.
  - That is, in general, a page-length document should manifest within a sentence.
  - Rule of thumb
    - articles → summarize into 3-5 sentences max.
    - book & documentaries → summarize and write it in my language, in 1-3 paragraphs.
    - journals & papers → summarize in my language, in 3 paragraphs.
- More to be added
