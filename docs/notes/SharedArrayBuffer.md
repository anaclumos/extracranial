- [SharedArrayBuffer - JavaScript | MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global\_Objects/SharedArrayBuffer)

SharedArrayBuffer is an object that holds a fixed-length binary buffer.
You can pass around comparably longer data with SharedArrayBuffer between agents (i.e., main thread and worker.)
A change in one ShardArrayBuffer will reflect on the other side.

```js
const sab = new SharedArrayBuffer(1024);
worker.postMessage(sab);
```

The Spectre vulnerability seized ShardArrayBuffer in 2018, and since 2020, ShardArrayBuffer requires a Secure Context to run.

For the host document, I need two headers to enable ShardArrayBuffer.

-   [`Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy) with `same-origin` as value (protects your origin from attackers)
-   [`Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy) with `require-corp` as value (protects victims from your origin)
