# Hey.

This section is my research note. I have extensively studied the topic of PKM and envisioned an online _source of truth_ that strongly integrated my projects and research. Here, you will find books I'm reading, articles I'm analyzing, and topics that grasped my interest.

This section will consist of notes in English and/or Korean, unless future myself randomly decides to learn a new language. I do _not_ intend to translate the notes, considering the scale.

The Docusaurus team is currently working on supporting PKM systems. Expect updates soon.
