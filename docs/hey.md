# Hey 👋🏼
## Intro

This is my research note. I have extensively studied the topic of PKM and envisioned an online _source of truth_ that strongly integrated my projects and research. Here, you will find books I'm reading, articles I'm analyzing, and topics that grasped my interest.

This section will consist of notes in English and/or Korean unless I randomly decide to learn a new language. I do not intend to translate the notes, considering the scale.

## Basic Rules for Note-taking
This PKM will *not* follow outliner UX. I believe in the potential of freeform text that flows. Also, I plan on constructing a PKM closer to Britannica rather than Wikipedia — make each note like a case study entry rather than an encyclopedia entry upfront.

- ASAP: ***As Short As Possible.***
- Keep the note Loosely folder-ed.
	- For personal use-case, I'd suggest simply putting the entire content into one mega folder.
	- assets, books, journals, notes...
- Do not make a data pile.
	- All content should retain its brevity.
	- I need to review them.
	- That is, in general, a page-length document should manifest within a sentence.
	- Rule of thumb
		- articles → summarize into 3-5 sentences max.
		- book & documentaries → summarize and write it in my language, in 1-3 paragraphs.
		- journals & papers → summarize in my language, in 3 paragraphs.
- More to be added
