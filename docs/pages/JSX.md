> JSX (JavaScript Syntax Extension and occasionally referred to as JavaScript XML) is a [React](./../.././docs/pages/React.md) extension to the JavaScript language syntax, which provides a way to structure component rendering using syntax familiar to many developers. It is similar in appearance to [HTML](./../.././docs/pages/HTML.md). [React](./../.././docs/pages/React.md) components are typically written using JSX, although they do not have to be, as components may also be written in pure JavaScript. JSX is similar to another extension syntax created by Meta (formerly Facebook) for PHP called XHP. [JSX (JavaScript)](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSX_(JavaScript)>)
