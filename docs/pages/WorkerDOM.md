[Google](./../.././docs/pages/Google.md)'s take on providing [DOM](./../.././docs/pages/DOM.md) access to [Web Worker](./../.././docs/pages/Web%20Worker.md) Threads.
[Brane](./../.././docs/pages/Brane.md) will follow WorkerDOM's core model.
WorkerDOM doesn't use [SharedArrayBuffer](./../.././docs/pages/SharedArrayBuffer.md), most likely to [Spectre](./../.././docs/pages/Spectre.md).
