RCS, or Rich Communication Services, is a messaging protocol for [Android](./../.././docs/pages/Android.md) devices that provides an upgraded messaging experience. RCS is an [alternative](./../.././docs/pages/Alternative.md) to [SMS](./../.././docs/pages/Text%20Message.md) and is similar to [iMessage](./../.././docs/pages/iMessage.md), WhatsApp, and [Facebook Messenger](./../.././docs/pages/Facebook%20Messenger.md). RCS offers richer text features, higher-resolution images and videos, and read receipts. RCS messages are also more secure than [SMS](./../.././docs/pages/Text%20Message.md) messages because they encrypt messages from user to client. Google's Android platform enables RCS and is accessible using either Google's Android Messages app or Samsung's Messages app.
