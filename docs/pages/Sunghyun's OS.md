After using Pantheon and NixOS for a while, I don't like the design and the feel. It just doesn't feel Mac. But I still want to escape the [Apple](./../.././docs/pages/Apple.md) ecosystem -- [Linux Device that keenly follows MacBook](./../.././docs/pages/Linux%20Device%20that%20keenly%20follows%20MacBook.md)

I want to build an [OS](./../.././docs/pages/OS.md) for real, probably on top of NixOS

Seems like I need to learn Vala

[OS](./../.././docs/pages/OS.md) itself would be free, but features will be paid add-on (like )
