A UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) is a 128-bit value or 36-character alphanumeric string that can be used to identify information across a computer system. UUIDs are designed to be globally unique and are often used to identify rows of data within a [database](./../.././docs/pages/Database.md) table, where each row is assigned a specific UUID. For example, most mobile devices have a unique ID, also called a UUID, assigned at the time of manufacture for identification purposes. UUIDs are sometimes called "GUID" or "Globally Unique Identifiers". The term "GUID" is also used, mostly in [Microsoft](./../.././docs/pages/Microsoft.md) systems. The specification for UUIDs was originally created by [Microsoft](./../.././docs/pages/Microsoft.md) and standardized by both the IETF and ITU.
