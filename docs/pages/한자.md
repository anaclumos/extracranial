Hanja (한자, 漢字) is the [Korean](./../.././docs/pages/%ED%95%9C%EA%B5%AD%EC%96%B4.md) word for Chinese characters. Hanja are Chinese characters that were borrowed and incorporated into the [Korean language](./../.././docs/pages/%ED%95%9C%EA%B5%AD%EC%96%B4.md) with Korean pronunciation. Hanja was used as early as the Gojoseon period under the first Korean kingdom. Although [Koreans](./../.././docs/pages/%ED%95%9C%EA%B5%AD%EC%9D%B8.md) use Hangul, a writing system developed 500 years ago for the [Korean language](./../.././docs/pages/%ED%95%9C%EA%B5%AD%EC%96%B4.md); Hanja is still used in conjunction with Hangul. Learning Hanja is optional for beginning [Korean language](./../.././docs/pages/%ED%95%9C%EA%B5%AD%EC%96%B4.md) students. However, because many Korean words come from [Chinese](./../.././docs/pages/%EC%A4%91%EA%B5%AD.md) roots, knowing Hanja can help master enough [vocabulary](./../.././docs/pages/Vocab.md) to become fluent in [Korean](./../.././docs/pages/%ED%95%9C%EA%B5%AD%EC%96%B4.md).
