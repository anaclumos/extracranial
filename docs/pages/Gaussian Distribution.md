The [Gaussian](./../.././docs/pages/Gaussian.md) [distribution](./../.././docs/pages/Distribution.md), also known as the normal [distribution](./../.././docs/pages/Distribution.md), is a continuous [probability](./../.././docs/pages/Probability.md) [distribution](./../.././docs/pages/Distribution.md) commonly used in statistical analysis. It is defined by the mean (μ) and the standard deviation (σ).

The PDF of the [Gaussian](./../.././docs/pages/Gaussian.md) [distribution](./../.././docs/pages/Distribution.md) is given by:

$$

f(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2\pi}} \cdot e^{-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}


$$

where $x$ is an actual number, $\mu$ is the mean of the [distribution](./../.././docs/pages/Distribution.md), $\sigma$ is the standard deviation, $\pi$ is the mathematical constant π, and $e$ is the mathematical constant e.

The [Gaussian](./../.././docs/pages/Gaussian.md) [distribution](./../.././docs/pages/Distribution.md) is symmetric about the mean, with the highest [probability](./../.././docs/pages/Probability.md) density occurring at the mean. As the standard deviation increases, the [distribution](./../.././docs/pages/Distribution.md) becomes more expansive and flatter.

One of the critical properties of the [Gaussian](./../.././docs/pages/Gaussian.md) [distribution](./../.././docs/pages/Distribution.md) is that about 68% of the observations fall within one standard deviation of the mean, about 95% of the observations fall within two standard deviations of the mean, and about 99.7% of the observations fall within three standard deviations of the mean.

The [Gaussian](./../.././docs/pages/Gaussian.md) [distribution](./../.././docs/pages/Distribution.md) is widely used in various fields, such as physics, engineering, [economics](./../.././docs/pages/Economy.md), and social sciences, due to its flexibility and ability to model many real-world phenomena. It is also a foundational concept in statistical inference, which involves making inferences about a population based on a sample of data.
