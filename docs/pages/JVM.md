JVM stands for Java Virtual Machine. It's a virtual machine or runtime environment that allows [Java](./../.././docs/pages/Java.md) programs to run on multiple devices and operating systems. The JVM interprets [Java](./../.././docs/pages/Java.md) bytecode to run as a program, providing a runtime environment to execute this process. It's an integral part of the [Java](./../.././docs/pages/Java.md) Runtime Environment (JRE).

The JVM is separate from its operating environment, supporting the "write once, run anywhere" philosophy. It enables a computer to run [Java](./../.././docs/pages/Java.md) programs as well as programs written in other languages that are also compiled into [Java](./../.././docs/pages/Java.md) bytecode.

The JVM translates bytecode into native machine code, which is a set of instructions that a computer's [CPU](./../.././docs/pages/CPU.md) executes directly.
