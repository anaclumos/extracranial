Computational linguistics combines linguistics, [computer science](./../.././docs/pages/Computer%20Science.md), and [artificial intelligence](./../.././docs/pages/AI.md) to develop algorithms, models, and systems that can process and analyze human [language](./../.././docs/pages/Language.md). It involves applying computational methods to [language](./../.././docs/pages/Language.md) study, including developing [Natural Language Processing](./../.././docs/pages/Natural%20Language%20Processing.md) ([NLP](./../.././docs/pages/Natural%20Language%20Processing.md)) technologies, machine translation, speech recognition, and text analysis.

The goal of computational linguistics is to enable machines to understand, interpret, and generate human [language](./../.././docs/pages/Language.md) so that they can communicate with humans more effectively. This involves building systems that can recognize speech, translate text, extract meaning from written or spoken [language](./../.././docs/pages/Language.md), and even generate natural-sounding and grammatically correct [language](./../.././docs/pages/Language.md).

Computational linguistics is interdisciplinary, drawing on knowledge and techniques from linguistics, [computer science](./../.././docs/pages/Computer%20Science.md), cognitive psychology, and mathematics. Its widespread applications include machine translation, sentiment analysis, question-answering systems, voice assistants, and chatbots, among many others.
