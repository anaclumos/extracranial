## What happened?

On December 15th, I landed in [Korea](./../.././docs/pages/%EB%8C%80%ED%95%9C%EB%AF%BC%EA%B5%AD.md) and did not have my phone service, so I used 600MB of data under the International Day Pass.
The next day, I had my local SIM working and disabled my AT&T sim from my phone (eSIM only, so I cannot eject).
I also turned off International Day Pass on my account, thinking I wouldn't need more roaming usage (I did not know I would be billed only for the day I use it).
I submitted the request to remove my IDP on December 16th, but the removal of IDP is backdated to December 15th, and AT&T charged me $1200 for the data I used under International Day Pass.
I tried asking AT&T support, but they said the charge was "valid" and could not do anything for me.
After days of back and forth and a two-hour support session, they finally admitted it was an AT&T error. They said,

> It was an AT&T error; expect the charges to be waived. A credit of $1150 would show on the account within 24-48 hours.

## Takeaways

For AT&T customers, never take away your International Data Pass.
It was interesting for me who grew up in [Korea](./../.././docs/pages/%EB%8C%80%ED%95%9C%EB%AF%BC%EA%B5%AD.md), to see that in the [United States](./../.././docs/pages/United%20States%20of%20America.md) you should protect and exercise your own rights proactively.
If a similar thing happened in [Korea](./../.././docs/pages/%EB%8C%80%ED%95%9C%EB%AF%BC%EA%B5%AD.md), I could've simply filed a dispute to the local government on my phone and they will basically autopilot everything to the conclusion.
Whereas in the [United States](./../.././docs/pages/United%20States%20of%20America.md), it is my job to negotiate and discuss the terms proactively, for my best interest.
