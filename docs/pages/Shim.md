> In computer programming, a shim is a library that transparently intercepts API calls and changes the arguments passed, handles the operation itself or redirects the operation elsewhere. Shims can be used to support an old API in a newer environment or a new API in an older environment. Shims can also be used to run programs on different software platforms than were developed for.
