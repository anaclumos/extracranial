NPM stands for Node Package Manager, which is the default package manager for the [JavaScript](./../.././docs/pages/JavaScript.md) runtime environment [Node.js](./../.././docs/pages/Node.js.md). NPM is used to install, share, and distribute code and to manage dependencies in your projects. It provides an online repository for hosting and sharing these packages and a command-line utility for interacting with this repository.
