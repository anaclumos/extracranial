[Old Someday](./../.././docs/pages/Old%20Someday.md) [Project](./../.././docs/pages/Project.md).

As [Apple](./../.././docs/pages/Apple.md) slowly moves to open up the [Apple](./../.././docs/pages/Apple.md) Pay restriction, what if someone provides a drop-in replacement for [Apple](./../.././docs/pages/Apple.md) Pay?

**Competitiveness**. Takes 2 seconds to switch from [Apple](./../.././docs/pages/Apple.md) Pay, but less cut on revenue.
