- [Korean](./../.././docs/pages/%ED%95%9C%EB%AF%BC%EC%A1%B1.md) writing service [Brunch](./../.././docs/pages/Brunch.md) violates [Apple](./../.././docs/pages/Apple.md)'s Terms of Use by using [SF Pro](./../.././docs/pages/San%20Francisco.md) as a [Webfont](./../.././docs/pages/Web%20Typography.md).
- I confirmed that [Apple](./../.././docs/pages/Apple.md) Employees knew about this and did not bother.
