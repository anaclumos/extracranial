In [statistics](./../.././docs/pages/Statistics.md), a normal table, also known as a [standard normal](./../.././docs/pages/Standard%20Normal.md) table or a z-table, is a table that provides probabilities associated with the [standard normal](./../.././docs/pages/Standard%20Normal.md) [distribution](./../.././docs/pages/Distribution.md). The table lists values of the [standard normal](./../.././docs/pages/Standard%20Normal.md) [distribution](./../.././docs/pages/Distribution.md)'s cumulative [distribution](./../.././docs/pages/Distribution.md) function (CDF) for different values of the standardized variable Z.

A [standard normal](./../.././docs/pages/Standard%20Normal.md) table typically provides probabilities for values of Z between -3.99 and 3.99 at intervals of 0.01. To use a [standard normal](./../.././docs/pages/Standard%20Normal.md) table, one must find the corresponding row and column for a given Z-score and then read off the [probability](./../.././docs/pages/Probability.md) associated with that value of Z.

For example, if we want to find the [probability](./../.././docs/pages/Probability.md) of a Z-score less than or equal to 1.96, we would look for the row corresponding to 1.9 and the column corresponding to 0.06 in the [standard normal](./../.././docs/pages/Standard%20Normal.md) table. The value at the intersection of the row and column is 0.9750, which indicates that the [probability](./../.././docs/pages/Probability.md) of a Z-score less than or equal to 1.96 is 0.9750, or 97.5%.

The [standard normal](./../.././docs/pages/Standard%20Normal.md) table is helpful in statistical inference and hypothesis testing, where it is often used to calculate critical values and p-values associated with the [standard normal](./../.././docs/pages/Standard%20Normal.md) [distribution](./../.././docs/pages/Distribution.md). It is also used to calculate confidence intervals and in various statistical models, such as linear and logistic regression.
