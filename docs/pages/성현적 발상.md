I realized that the _closest_ term I could find is [lateral thinking](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lateral_thinking), even though there are some caveats.

Somewhat based on [지름길과 돌파구 (15誠鉉)](./../.././docs/pages/%EC%A7%80%EB%A6%84%EA%B8%B8%EA%B3%BC%20%EB%8F%8C%ED%8C%8C%EA%B5%AC%20%2815%E8%AA%A0%E9%89%89%29.md), only in some cases.

But most of them revolve around an unprecedented combination of lateral technological applications.
