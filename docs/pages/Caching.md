- When the processor reads or writes, it will check if the cache contains the desired data.
- [Principles of Locality](./../.././docs/pages/Principles%20of%20Locality.md)
  - **Spacial Locality**. Entire blocks are transferred from the memory.
  - **Temporal Locality**. Leave data that is likely to be reaccessed. Least-recently-used blocks are evicted.

- Cache Hit: Yes, we found a copy of what we want in the cache!
