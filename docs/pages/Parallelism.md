- **Instruction Level Parallelism** (ILP): Overlapping instructions within a single process/thread of execution. Diminishing returns in 2000-2005. Silicon and energy costs are growing faster than performance, inefficient after a point
- **Thread Level Parallelism** (TLP): Overlap execution of multiple processes/threads
- **Data Level Parallelism** (DLP): Overlap an operation (instruction) that is to be applied independently to multiple data values (usually, an array)
