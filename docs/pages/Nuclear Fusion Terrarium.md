Can we create a Terrarium with a [nuclear fusion](./../.././docs/pages/Nuclear%20Fusion.md) core inside to create an everlasting capsule? If so, can we create a [Nuclear Fusion Edible Capsule](./../.././docs/pages/Nuclear%20Fusion%20Edible%20Capsule.md) that would emit some of the remaining energy in APT form to break through the [Neo-Malthusian Trap](./../.././docs/pages/Malthusian%20Trap.md)?
