An idea suggested on [2022-07-14](./../.././docs/journals/2022-07-14.md) that all inventions should be _fiercely overpriced_.

To attain [FIRE](./../.././docs/pages/FIRE.md), we have previously explored that [Software as a Service](./../.././docs/pages/Software%20as%20a%20Service.md) would be one way to go.
However, good _engineering_ and good _product_ differ significantly.
One major roadblock would be the lack of expertise in payment infra.
What if we start from a _simple_ yet _overpriced_ [Software as a Service](./../.././docs/pages/Software%20as%20a%20Service.md) product to test how to get monetized?
The purpose is not to generate revenue by itself but to examine and get enough data out on how the real-world [Software as a Service](./../.././docs/pages/Software%20as%20a%20Service.md) [FIRE](./../.././docs/pages/FIRE.md) will work out.

**Examples**.
A book recommendation web app, but _you need to pay to use it_.
[Book Metadata as a Service](./../.././docs/pages/Book%20Metadata%20as%20a%20Service.md) could also be one example.

## Ads? Purchases?

[MAKE (Book)](./../.././docs/pages/MAKE%20%28Book%29.md) suggests asking for money directly from the customers.

### [How I Built a Website to Earn Passive Income With Google AdSense](https://www.businessinsider.com/passive-income-built-website-google-adsense-2023-5)

Avi Wilensky, a web developer from [New York City](./../.././docs/pages/New%20York%20City.md), narrates his experience creating and monetizing the Up Hail web application, a comparison site for ride-sharing services and taxis. Initially, Wilensky built the website as a weekend side project to fulfill a niche need he identified. When featured in Mashable's list of best web tools, the application garnered attention, encouraging Wilensky to enhance the site further. He monetized the platform with increased traffic using Google AdSense, leading to significant passive income.

1. Automate your infrastructure
2. Monetize your site with ad networks: Utilize ad networks like Google's AdSense
3. Keep user acquisition costs low: Organic channels, emphasizing [Search Engine Optimization](./../.././docs/pages/Search%20Engine%20Optimization.md) ([SEO](./../.././docs/pages/Search%20Engine%20Optimization.md)).
4. Keep infrastructure costs low: Utility of public cloud providers like [AWS](./../.././docs/pages/AWS.md) or Microsoft Azure to minimize recurring expenses.
