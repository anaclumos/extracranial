An idea suggested on [2022-07-14](./../.././docs/journals/2022-07-14.md) that all inventions should be _fiercely overpriced_.

To attain [FIRE](./../.././docs/pages/FIRE.md), we have previously explored that [Software as a Service](./../.././docs/pages/Software%20as%20a%20Service.md) would be one way to go.
However, good _engineering_ and a good _product_ are very different.
One major roadblock would be the lack of expertise in payment infra.
What if we start from a _simple_ yet _overpriced_ [Software as a Service](./../.././docs/pages/Software%20as%20a%20Service.md) product to test how to get monetized?
The purpose is not to generate revenue by itself but to examine and get enough data out on how the real-world [Software as a Service](./../.././docs/pages/Software%20as%20a%20Service.md) [FIRE](./../.././docs/pages/FIRE.md) will work out.

**Examples**.
A book recommendation web app but _you need to pay to use it_.
[Book Metadata as a Service](./../.././docs/pages/Book%20Metadata%20as%20a%20Service.md) could also be one example.
