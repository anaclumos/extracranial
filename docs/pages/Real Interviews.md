## For 2023

- [Palantir](./../.././docs/pages/Palantir.md)

  - technical design of a class registration system (higher level engineering)
  - technical design of a package manager proxy server (multithreading)

- [Grammarly](./../.././docs/pages/Grammarly.md)

  - 1 Q on removing adjacent duplicates
    - simple $O(n^2)$ algorithm
    - improved to $O(n)$ algorithm using stack
    - can improve space complexity from now on but cannot improve time complexity.
  - 1 Followup Q on removing length adjacent duplicates arbitrarily
    - $O(nk)$ algorithm
    - Had even more time left, so I discussed with the interviewer and improved to $O(n)$ algorithm ðŸ˜ƒ
  - Learned that [Grammarly](./../.././docs/pages/Grammarly.md) has internal projects, Readerly (summarizing) and Speakerly ([Synthote](./../.././docs/pages/Synthote.md))

- [Palantir](https://www.palantir.com/)

  - 3 basic questions (analyzing algorithms and complexities)
  - 3 [Leetcode](./../.././docs/pages/Leetcode.md) Easy to Medium Problem
    - Question involved constructing trees and traversing them
    - Each question is built on top of previous queries, getting gradually harder.
    - However, the most challenging question was still [Leetcode](./../.././docs/pages/Leetcode.md) Medium level.

- [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/) with [Karat](https://karat.com/)

  - 3 basic questions (analyzing algorithms and complexities)
  - 1 [Leetcode](./../.././docs/pages/Leetcode.md) Hard level question
    - Involved in Game State Change, Constructing Adjacency List of Game States, and Pathfinding
    - Given a Game Board, find a list of moves from the start state to the end state

- [Databricks](https://www.databricks.com/)
  - 2 1-hour interview
    - 1 conceptual, technical design (data pipelines & tradeoffs)
    - 1 conditional [BFS](./../.././docs/pages/BFS.md) problem
