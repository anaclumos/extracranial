Meltdown is one of the two original transient execution [CPU](./../.././docs/pages/CPU.md) vulnerabilities (the other being [Spectre](./../.././docs/pages/Spectre.md)). Meltdown affects Intel x86 microprocessors, IBM POWER processors, and some [ARM](./../.././docs/pages/ARM%20Architecture.md)-based microprocessors. It allows a rogue process to read all memory, even when it is not authorized to do so. [Meltdown (security vulnerability)](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meltdown_(security_vulnerability)>)
