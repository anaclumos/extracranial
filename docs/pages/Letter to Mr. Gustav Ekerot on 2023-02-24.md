- [Letter](./../.././docs/pages/Mail.md) to Mr. Gustav Ekerot on [2023-02-24](./../.././docs/journals/2023-02-24.md)

## [2023-02-24](./../.././docs/journals/2023-02-24.md)

Dear Mr. Ekerot,

I am Sunghyun -- The one who sent you 10s of [emails](./../.././docs/pages/Mail.md) since the early days of [tabExtend](./../.././docs/pages/tabExtend.md). I hope you are doing well. It's been a long time since we last spoke, and I'm reaching out to see how you've been doing.

I wanted to let you know that I recently changed my [email](./../.././docs/pages/Mail.md) address from [mail@chosunghyun.com](mailto:mail@chosunghyun.com) to [hey@cho.sh](mailto:hey@cho.sh). If you need to reach me, please use this new [email](./../.././docs/pages/Mail.md) address.

Also, I've been keeping a research journal on [https://cho.sh](https://cho.sh/) these days. It's a convenient platform for me to organize my thoughts and ideas. If you're interested, feel free to check it out.

I have a question about your [extension](./../.././docs/pages/WebExtension.md), [tabExtend](./../.././docs/pages/tabExtend.md). I recently switched to [Firefox](./../.././docs/pages/Firefox.md) and noticed the [extension](./../.././docs/pages/WebExtension.md) is unavailable on the [Firefox](./../.././docs/pages/Firefox.md) Add-ons Store. Do you have any plans to add it? As far as I know, [Firefox](./../.././docs/pages/Firefox.md) can "straight up" run [Chrome](./../.././docs/pages/Chrome.md) extensions, so I imagine uploading it to the [Firefox](./../.././docs/pages/Firefox.md) Add-ons Store wouldn't take long. It would take a maximum of 10 minutes.

Please let me know your thoughts on this. I appreciate your time and hope that you are doing well.

Best Regards,
Sunghyun Cho

Dear Mr. Ekerot,

Wow, I have not heard of such things. Jitter looks precisely like what I was looking for. I'll take a closer look later and update the website.

[tabOS](./../.././docs/pages/tabOS.md) looks way cleaner, and I like the interface a lot. I used it for a couple of minutes, and some first thoughts:

- Love the double-click interface. It does feel like an OS. If I were using a Chromebook, this is the first [extension](./../.././docs/pages/WebExtension.md) I would install.
- [Animation](./../.././docs/pages/Animation.md) are way more fluid and polished, pushing further from the already-masterpiece [tabExtend](./../.././docs/pages/tabExtend.md).
- That being said, some of the space does seem redundant and may be utilized better. For example, the lack of Kanban like [tabExtend](./../.././docs/pages/tabExtend.md) is a huge dealbreaker for me.
- Finally, I would like the possibility of [tabExtend](./../.././docs/pages/tabExtend.md) or [tabOS](./../.././docs/pages/tabOS.md) coming to [FF](./../.././docs/pages/Firefox.md) [🔥🦊](./../.././docs/pages/Firefox.md) [❤🔥](./../.././docs/pages/Firefox.md)

That said, you made me have a shower-thought if there was "[One and Only WebExtension](./../.././docs/pages/One%20and%20Only%20WebExtension.md)" for [Firefox](./../.././docs/pages/Firefox.md) and [Safari](./../.././docs/pages/Safari.md). It will essentially be a VM of [Chrome](./../.././docs/pages/Chrome.md) Extensions -- This One and Only [WebExtension](./../.././docs/pages/WebExtension.md) will install [Chrome](./../.././docs/pages/Chrome.md) [Extension](./../.././docs/pages/WebExtension.md) within itself and proxy all of the requests to [Safari](./../.././docs/pages/Safari.md) & [FF](./../.././docs/pages/Firefox.md). Ultimately it will bring the entire [Chrome](./../.././docs/pages/Chrome.md) [Extension](./../.././docs/pages/WebExtension.md) Library to [Firefox](./../.././docs/pages/Firefox.md) and [Safari](./../.././docs/pages/Safari.md). Maybe I'll build it one day and [paywall](./../.././docs/pages/Fiercely%20Overpriced.md) it to install more than 5 extensions or so. 🤣

Anyways. Your teams always inspire me, given how small, fast, and powerful you are. I hope you keep up your great work!

Best Regards,  
Sunghyun Cho
