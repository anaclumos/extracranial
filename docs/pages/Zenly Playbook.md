[Zenly](./../.././docs/pages/Zenly.md), a popular Gen-Z location-sharing social app, shut down two days ago. So how did this French [hidden champion](./../.././docs/pages/Small%20yet%20Powerful.md) flourish and vanish? And what can we learn from it?

## Playbook

**Unparalleled technology**. The market has dozens of location-tracking apps that are either battery hoarders or inaccurate at best (not real-time or not precise.) [Zenly](./../.././docs/pages/Zenly.md) shows surprising accuracy and battery efficiency from a 3-year research [project](./../.././docs/pages/Project.md) for a child safety app before founding [Zenly](./../.././docs/pages/Zenly.md). Even from the early days, [Zenly](./../.././docs/pages/Zenly.md) hired [Ph.D.](./../.././docs/pages/Ph.D..md)-level [researchers](./../.././docs/pages/Researcher.md) to acquire unparalleled tech talents. Server and [Front-end](./../.././docs/pages/Front-end.md) engineers were mainly seniors, forming a small elite team.

**Targeting the right group**. [Zenly](./../.././docs/pages/Zenly.md) targeted Gen-Z's, finding that when a quarter of a school uses [Zenly](./../.././docs/pages/Zenly.md), it takes less than a week to saturate the entire school. [Zenly](./../.././docs/pages/Zenly.md) focused on sub-group-led growths; for example, [Japanese](./../.././docs/pages/%EC%9D%BC%EB%B3%B8.md) students studying abroad at Taiwanese University eventually spread [Zenly](./../.././docs/pages/Zenly.md) to the whole island. One interesting note was that teenagers surprisingly did not care about privacy; the CEO regretted that privacy concerns in the early days were a waste of time--the market always outmove makers.

**Branding**. Location tracking is creepy, so they aimed the _Best Friend Forever_ or _In Real Life Friend_ vibe: pop interface, Gen-Z copywriting, cute colors, and smiley [emoji](./../.././docs/pages/Emoji.md) everywhere. When asking for the actual location, it emphasized spending good times with your friends rather than the location tracking itself.

** Acquiring talents**. [Zenly](./../.././docs/pages/Zenly.md) had not only exceptional engineers but also outstanding designers and operators. [10x](./../.././docs/pages/10x.md) people don't join a startup upfront, so [Zenly](./../.././docs/pages/Zenly.md) made them involved in the company by hiring them as a freelancer and then onboarded them to the team.

## [Zenly](./../.././docs/pages/Zenly.md), now part of history

From the Stay Home challenge in 2020 to a mass-scale [3D](./../.././docs/pages/3D.md) [map](./../.././docs/pages/Cartography.md) update in 2022, [Zenly](./../.././docs/pages/Zenly.md) prepared for its upcoming future. However, the recent layoff at Snap wiped out the [Zenly](./../.././docs/pages/Zenly.md) team alongside the Snap [Mini App](./../.././docs/pages/Mini%20App.md) team. I do think this is Snap's mistake. Even my university peers do not use Snap anymore but still use [Zenly](./../.././docs/pages/Zenly.md). It almost feels like [Facebook](./../.././docs/pages/Facebook.md) is killing [Instagram](./../.././docs/pages/Instagram.md) for [Facebook](./../.././docs/pages/Facebook.md). I hope [Zenly](./../.././docs/pages/Zenly.md)'s revolutionary DNA gets well-integrated into Snap, seeking revival.
