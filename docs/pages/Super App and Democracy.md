## [Why an everything app is a bad news for liberal democracies and free markets](https://www.nitinpai.in/2022/10/10/why-an-everything-app-is-bad-news-for-liberal-democracies-and-free-markets)

- Many technology entrepreneurs dream of an "[Everything App](./../.././docs/pages/Super%20App.md)", a smartphone application that will deliver everything to everyone on the planet.
- Elon [Elon Musk](./../.././docs/pages/Elon%20Musk.md) has become the latest investor [to declare an ambition](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-10-04/musk-says-buying-twitter-speeds-up-creating-an-everything-app) to build such a super-app wanting to emulate the success of [WeChat](./../.././docs/pages/WeChat.md), a [Chinese](./../.././docs/pages/%EC%A4%91%EA%B5%AD.md) super-app.
- The [Everything app](./../.././docs/pages/Super%20App.md) presents massive risks to personal, [economic](./../.././docs/pages/Economy.md), and political freedom.
- As [John Gruber of Daring Fireball](https://daringfireball.net/2022/10/everything) says, "It's no coincidence at all that [WeChat](./../.././docs/pages/WeChat.md) is the only "[everything app](./../.././docs/pages/Super%20App.md)" anyone can cite, and it comes from China, an authoritarian regime.
- It doesn't benefit users that [WeChat](./../.././docs/pages/WeChat.md) dominates all aspects of digital life . It helps the authoritarian Chinese Communist Party.
- The user is socially locked into a 'private' company for performing any or all socio-[economic](./../.././docs/pages/Economy.md) functions.
- Public policy must act to prevent firms and apps from acquiring socioeconomic dominance in the first place
  - Nurture a competitive market.
  - Promote open public digital infrastructure with [interoperability](./../.././docs/pages/Interoperability.md).
- At a deeper level, [Elon Musk](./../.././docs/pages/Elon%20Musk.md)'s desire to emulate the [Chinese](./../.././docs/pages/%EC%A4%91%EA%B5%AD.md) model alerts us to the danger of the interests of Big Tech increasingly diverging from those of liberal democracies.
- Preserving our freedom may indeed be their most important corporate social responsibility.
