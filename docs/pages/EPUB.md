> EPUB is an e-book file format that uses the ".epub" file extension. The term is short for electronic publication and is sometimes styled ePub. EPUB is supported by many e-readers, and compatible software is available for most smartphones, tablets, and computers. EPUB is a technical standard published by the International Digital Publishing Forum (IDPF). It became an official standard of the IDPF in September 2007, superseding the older Open [eBook](./../.././docs/pages/eBook.md) (OEB) standard. [EPUB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPUB)
