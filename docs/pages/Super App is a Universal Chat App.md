- [성현적 발상](./../.././docs/pages/%EC%84%B1%ED%98%84%EC%A0%81%20%EB%B0%9C%EC%83%81.md)
- As noted on the [Letter to Mr. Matt Rickard on 2022-12-24](./../.././docs/pages/Letter%20to%20Mr.%20Matt%20Rickard%20on%202022-12-24.md), the conditions for a [Super App](./../.././docs/pages/Super%20App.md) in the [United States](./../.././docs/pages/United%20States%20of%20America.md) are vague. [Apple](./../.././docs/pages/Apple.md) and [Google](./../.././docs/pages/Google.md) divide the tech market into two, not only in terms of [iOS](./../.././docs/pages/iOS.md) vs. Android but also as App [Economy](./../.././docs/pages/Economy.md) vs. Web [Economy](./../.././docs/pages/Economy.md), Closed vs. (fairly) Open, [Edge](./../.././docs/pages/Edge.md)-first [AI](./../.././docs/pages/AI.md) vs. Cloud-first [AI](./../.././docs/pages/AI.md), etc.
- [Twitter](./../.././docs/pages/Twitter.md), [Facebook](./../.././docs/pages/Facebook.md), [Instagram](./../.././docs/pages/Instagram.md), and Snapchat cannot be super apps because they have specific fan groups and [anti](./../.././docs/pages/Anti.md)-fan groups. So the [Super app](./../.././docs/pages/Super%20App.md) needs to be universal.
- Universal, like a chat app. Chat app doesn't have a specific like-dislike. It's just a chat app.
- the [super app](./../.././docs/pages/Super%20App.md) must draw people, giving reasons to download and continue using them. Chat app if a critical mass onboard cannot stop. Especially with group chat, as we learned from [Kakao](./../.././docs/pages/Kakao.md).

## Mental Simulation of Firefox and Signal as a Super App

- They must have a first instantly absorbable mass of users. The main target of Signal and [Firefox](./../.././docs/pages/Firefox.md) are people who are flexible to switch platforms if they satisfy their specific needs, i.e., privacy in this case. They are also very tech-savvy and have plasticity.
- [Super app](./../.././docs/pages/Super%20App.md) needs technical talent, building a new platform, server techs, emulation techs, etc., as learned in [Brane](./../.././docs/pages/Brane.md) and [Web.dev Mini App Review](https://web.dev/mini-apps/). [Firefox](./../.././docs/pages/Firefox.md) has this talent, as seen in the Gecko [engine](./../.././docs/pages/Engine.md).
- So, imagine someone acquiring both Signal and [Firefox](./../.././docs/pages/Firefox.md) to build a universal chat app that can emulate and run small snippet programs.
- This may be the closest vision for a [Super App](./../.././docs/pages/Super%20App.md) in the Americas.
