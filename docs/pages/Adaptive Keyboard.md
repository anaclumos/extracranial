At one point in history, [Apple](./../.././docs/pages/Apple.md) was known to experiment with this with MacBook Pro 2016 release (Apple Reportedly Working On A Magic Keyboard With E-Ink Display Keys - Video](https://wccftech.com/apple-reportedly-working-magic-keyboard-eink-display-keys-video/)) They used e-ink for adaptive keyboards. Then they scraped it, and rumors indicated they moved to [OLED](./../.././docs/pages/OLED.md), now seen on touch-bar macs. The rumor, however, did not end on the touch bar; the entire keyboard area was made with [OLED](./../.././docs/pages/OLED.md) buttons.
