Dear Mr. [Rickard](./../.././docs/pages/Matt%20Rickard.md),

> Another example of this is Ghost... another Rails monolith.

AFAIK Ghost is Node.js, not Rails! [https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost)

But you have a great point; you once mentioned that most tech services could be abstracted to an [edge](./../.././docs/pages/Edge.md)-served Front-end and back-end as [edge](./../.././docs/pages/Edge.md)-replicated simple data storage. I was also a long-time Ghost user, and I agree that Ghost's tech stack can be vastly simplified as such. Ghost's central-hosted-ness was helpful in some niches (ex: I can keep writing where I left off on my other devices), but Ghost, or "Writing Services," can be much better.

It would be much better to see a first-class serverless email API (as in doing slightly more than Nodemailer or EmailEngine, i.e., [SMIME](./../.././docs/pages/SMIME.md) or, more recently â€” Brand Indicators for Message Identification [BIMI](./../.././docs/pages/BIMI.md)) Just like what Vercel did to Heroku.

Best Regards,

Sunghyun Cho
