- VP9 and HEVC are video compression standards that aim to reduce the file size and bandwidth of 4K videos.
- [Apple](./../.././docs/pages/Apple.md) only supports HEVC, while [Google](./../.././docs/pages/Google.md) only supports VP9.
- We used to be able to watch 4K YouTube videos encoded in H264 in ~2016. [Google](./../.././docs/pages/Google.md) switched to VP9 only for 4K videos, essentially banning 4K videos on [Apple](./../.././docs/pages/Apple.md) [Safari](./../.././docs/pages/Safari.md) and [iOS](./../.././docs/pages/iOS.md) YouTube.
- Not only that, [macOS](./../.././docs/pages/macOS.md) devices only got VP9 decoders in MacBook Pro 2019. Technically we could watch 4K+ videos using [Chrome](./../.././docs/pages/Chrome.md) on MacBooks, but the videos were decoded on [CPUs](./../.././docs/pages/CPU.md), using the [CPU](./../.././docs/pages/CPU.md) 400%.
- Starting [iOS](./../.././docs/pages/iOS.md) 14, [Apple](./../.././docs/pages/Apple.md) added VP9 support; [Google](./../.././docs/pages/Google.md) eventually won. Now we can play 4K videos on [macOS](./../.././docs/pages/macOS.md) [Safari](./../.././docs/pages/Safari.md) and [iOS](./../.././docs/pages/iOS.md) YouTube using this. [Apple](./../.././docs/pages/Apple.md) [GPU](./../.././docs/pages/GPU.md) also now supports VP9 decoding.
- Similar to [USDZ vs glTF](./../.././docs/pages/USDZ%20vs%20glTF.md)
