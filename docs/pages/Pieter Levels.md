Pieter Levels is a Dutch entrepreneur known for his innovative work in the realm of [digital nomadism](./../.././docs/pages/Antipreneur.md). He's the creator of several successful online businesses and platforms, which he built while traveling the world. One of his best-known projects is Nomad List, a website that rates cities around the world based on criteria such as cost of living, internet speed, safety, and weather, to help digital nomads decide where to live and work. He also created Remote OK, a job board for remote jobs, and Hoodmaps, a crowdsourced [map](./../.././docs/pages/Map.md) to navigate cities based on local insights. His work focuses on building platforms that enable and facilitate remote and nomadic work. He is also recognized for his minimalist approach to building startups, often working alone or with small teams, and his transparency about his revenue and methods, which he often shares online.
