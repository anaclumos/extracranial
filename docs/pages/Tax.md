In the [USA](./../.././docs/pages/United%20States%20of%20America.md), taxes on income and long-term capital gains (profits from selling assets like [stocks](./../.././docs/pages/Stock.md)) vary based on your income. Some states also have income taxes. You have to pay these taxes when you earn income or make a profit from selling assets.
