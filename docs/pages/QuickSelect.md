> In [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science 'Computer science'), **quickselect** is a [selection algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_algorithm 'Selection algorithm') to find the $k$th smallest element in an unordered list. It is related to the [quicksort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort 'Quicksort') sorting algorithm. Like quicksort, it was developed by [Tony Hoare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Hoare 'Tony Hoare'), and this is also known as **Hoare's selection algorithm**. Like quicksort, it is efficient in practice and has good average-case performance but poor worst-case performance. Quickselect and its variants are the selection algorithms most often used in efficient real-world implementations. [Quickselect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quickselect)
