Master Master Detail is when Master is nested a lot. Naturally it results in less area for the detail. To mitigate that, we introduced foldable masters and master replacing the grandmaster, but it's not intuitive or fluid to use.

What if there is a [Master Detail](./../.././docs/pages/Master%20Detail.md) with [Sliding Panes](./../.././docs/pages/Sliding%20Panes.md)? I think it'll make a lot of sense in [Horizontally Stacked Interface](./../.././docs/pages/Horizontally%20Stacked%20Interface.md)

## [2024-08-20](./../.././docs/journals/2024-08-20.md)

Not sliding but auto-truncating. Got the idea from Apple's Finder Column view and [Andy Matuschak](./../.././docs/pages/Andy%20Matuschak.md)'s Sliding Panes, with Obsidian's.
