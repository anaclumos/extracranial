In computer science, "headless" typically refers to software or hardware that operates without a graphical user interface (GUI) or display. This means that the software can run in the background without a visual interface and can be controlled and manipulated using command line interfaces (CLI), APIs, or other forms of remote access. For example, a headless [browser](./../.././docs/pages/Web%20Browser.md) is a [web browser](./../.././docs/pages/Web%20Browser.md) that can operate without a graphical user interface. It can be used for automated testing or web [scraping](./../.././docs/pages/Crawler.md), as it can access and interact with web pages just like a regular [browser](./../.././docs/pages/Web%20Browser.md), but all interactions are performed programmatically. Similarly, a headless server or headless device operates without a screen, keyboard, or mouse and is usually managed remotely using a command-line interface or other tools.
