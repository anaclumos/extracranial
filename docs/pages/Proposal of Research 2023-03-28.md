## Investigating Authority Systems to Mitigate [Prompt Injection](./../.././docs/pages/Prompt%20Injection.md) Attacks in [Generative Text AI](./../.././docs/pages/Generative%20AI.md) Models

### Abstract

Large Language Models ([LLMs](./../.././docs/pages/LLM.md)) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in answering [natural language](./../.././docs/pages/Natural%20Language.md) questions and adapting to new tasks through clever prompting. However, this adaptability might expose [LLMs](./../.././docs/pages/LLM.md) to security risks, such as [Prompt Injection](./../.././docs/pages/Prompt%20Injection.md) (PI) attacks. In this research proposal, we seek to investigate an authority system for [LLMs](./../.././docs/pages/LLM.md) to differentiate instructions from trusted sources and unknown figures. Furthermore, we aim to assess the feasibility of such an authority system and explore potential mitigation techniques to defend [LLMs](./../.././docs/pages/LLM.md) against PI attacks.

### Background

Recent studies have shown that [LLMs](./../.././docs/pages/LLM.md) can be susceptible to PI attacks, which prompted the model to produce malicious content or override the original instructions. These attacks are brutal to mitigate due to the [LLM](./../.././docs/pages/LLM.md)'s nature of following instructions. As [LLMs](./../.././docs/pages/LLM.md) are integrated into various applications and systems, including those with retrieval and [API](./../.././docs/pages/API.md) calling capabilities, new attack vectors arise, posing a threat to the security and privacy of users.

### Research Questions

- How can we design an authority system for Generative Text AIs to differentiate between trusted and untrusted instructions?
- Can the authority system efficiently mitigate [Prompt Injection](./../.././docs/pages/Prompt%20Injection.md) attacks in various scenarios?
- How can mitigation techniques defend [LLMs](./../.././docs/pages/LLM.md) against PI attacks in an authority system?

### Methodology

- Literature review: Conduct a comprehensive review of current PI attack techniques and mitigation [strategies](./../.././docs/pages/Strategy.md) to identify gaps in existing knowledge and potential areas for improvement.
- Design an authority system: Develop a conceptual model of an authority system for Generative Text AIs, focusing on differentiating between trusted and untrusted instructions.
- Test the authority system: Implement the designed authority system on a selected [LLM](./../.././docs/pages/LLM.md) and assess its performance in mitigating PI attacks.
- Evaluate mitigation techniques: Investigate potential mitigation techniques that can be integrated with the authority system to enhance the [LLM](./../.././docs/pages/LLM.md)'s defense against PI attacks.
- Validation and improvement: Refine the authority system and mitigation techniques to achieve optimal performance based on the results.

### Expected Outcomes

- A comprehensive understanding of the current PI attack landscape and existing mitigation techniques.
- A proposed authority system for Generative Text AIs capable of differentiating between trusted and untrusted instructions.
- An evaluation of the authority system's effectiveness in mitigating PI attacks in different scenarios.
- A set of potential mitigation techniques that can enhance the [LLM](./../.././docs/pages/LLM.md)'s defense against PI attacks when integrated with the authority system.

### Significance

This research will contribute to understanding PI attacks and their potential consequences in the context of [LLMs](./../.././docs/pages/LLM.md). Furthermore, it will help develop an authority system for Generative Text AIs and propose mitigation techniques that can be employed to enhance the security and privacy of users as [LLMs](./../.././docs/pages/LLM.md) are integrated into more applications and systems.

### Abstract

The advent of [Generative AIs](./../.././docs/pages/Generative%20AI.md) presents new opportunities for [font](./../.././docs/pages/Font.md) generation, specifically in replicating handwriting fonts and their dynamic features. Unfortunately, traditional [font](./../.././docs/pages/Font.md)-generating services have been limited in capturing the natural flow of handwritten text, resulting in less realistic and less aesthetically pleasing fonts. This study explores the implementation of [Generative AI](./../.././docs/pages/Generative%20AI.md) in creating handwriting fonts that consider dynamic [font features](./../.././docs/pages/Font%20Features.md), such as variations in character appearance based on their position within a word.
