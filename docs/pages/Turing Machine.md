> A Turing machine is a mathematical model of computation describing an abstract machine that manipulates symbols on a strip of tape according to a table of rules. Despite the model's simplicity, it is capable of implementing any computer algorithm. [Turing machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine)
