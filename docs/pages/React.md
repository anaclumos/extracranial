> React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a free and open-source [front-end](./../.././docs/pages/Front-end.md) JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on [UI](./../.././docs/pages/UIUX.md) components. It is maintained by Meta (formerly Facebook) and a community of individual developers and companies. React can be used as a base in the development of single-page, mobile, or server-rendered applications with frameworks like Next.js. However, React is only concerned with state management and rendering that state to the [DOM](./../.././docs/pages/DOM.md), so creating React applications usually requires additional libraries for routing and certain client-side functionality.
