Thoughts on [2023-07-12](./../.././docs/journals/2023-07-12.md)

- People I follow on [Twitter](./../.././docs/pages/Twitter.md) are **not** my high school friends I follow on [Instagram](./../.././docs/pages/Instagram.md).
- Having instant 100 followers may seem significant on paper, but that also means it would be **hard to overturn.** Even if I follow more tech people on Threads, I am still less likely to see relevant content because I was subscribed to a massive uninteresting group
- Plus, many people, especially outside of the core tech bubble, have different **persona** on [Insta](./../.././docs/pages/Instagram.md) and [Twitter](./../.././docs/pages/Twitter.md). Not a wise idea to merge the two.
- This inertia will eventually lead to an uninteresting platform and be a mediocre platform at best, IMO.
- The significant contributor would be the [Fediverse](./../.././docs/pages/Fediverse.md). If they can interoperate with the [AT protocol](./../.././docs/pages/AT%20protocol.md) ([Bluesky](./../.././docs/pages/Bluesky.md)), [ActivityPub](./../.././docs/pages/ActivityPub.md) protocol ([Mastodon](./../.././docs/pages/Mastodon.md)), and the [Matrix Network](./../.././docs/pages/Matrix%20Network.md) (Instant Messaging Standard), Threads will have a chance.
- But the [Fediverse](./../.././docs/pages/Fediverse.md) Zuck is trying to advertise seems like a PR show to enter the [EU](./../.././docs/pages/EU.md) market with minimum regulations. [FB](./../.././docs/pages/Meta%20%28Company%29.md) will [FB](./../.././docs/pages/Meta%20%28Company%29.md) anyways, which won't likely happen.
