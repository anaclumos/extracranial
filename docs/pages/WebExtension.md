A web extension is a software module that adds functionality to a [web browser](./../.././docs/pages/Web%20Browser.md). It's a type of [browser](./../.././docs/pages/Web%20Browser.md) extension that can modify or enhance the functionality of a web [browser](./../.././docs/pages/Web%20Browser.md) by adding new features, tools, and user interfaces.

Web extensions are typically built using web technologies such as HTML, [CSS](./../.././docs/pages/CSS.md), and JavaScript. They can interact with the content of web pages and the [browser](./../.././docs/pages/Web%20Browser.md) itself, allowing them to add or modify functionality in various ways.

Examples of common web extensions include ad-blockers, password managers, and social media integrations. They can be installed directly from the [browser](./../.././docs/pages/Web%20Browser.md)'s extension store and typically work across multiple operating systems and [browser](./../.././docs/pages/Web%20Browser.md) platforms. In addition, many popular [web browsers](./../.././docs/pages/Web%20Browser.md), such as [Google Chrome](./../.././docs/pages/Chrome.md), Mozilla [Firefox](./../.././docs/pages/Firefox.md), and Microsoft Edge, support the development and use of web extensions.
