## ...Startup

- Even the most agile startups are overstaffed.

## ...Government

- Governments are definitely overstaffed.
- This could be a potential answer to [Small Government vs Big Government](./../.././docs/pages/Small%20Government%20vs%20Big%20Government.md)
- Governmental services should also conform to the [API Economy](./../.././docs/pages/API%20Economy.md)

Small teams are mighty.

13 people built Instagram to $1B acquisition

17 people built Linear to 1,000 customers

40 people built Notion to 1M+ users

When you bring together a small &amp; senior team - amazing things can happen.
