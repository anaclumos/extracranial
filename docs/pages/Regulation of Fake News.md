### [How Twitter Rigged the Covid Debate](https://www.thefp.com/p/how-twitter-rigged-the-covid-debate)

- The [United States](./../.././docs/pages/United%20States%20of%20America.md) government pressured [Twitter](./../.././docs/pages/Twitter.md) to elevate certain content and suppress other content about Covid-19 and the pandemic. Internal [emails](./../.././docs/pages/Mail.md) that I viewed on [Twitter](./../.././docs/pages/Twitter.md) showed that both the Trump and Biden administrations directly pressed [Twitter](./../.././docs/pages/Twitter.md) executives to moderate the platform's content according to their wishes
- But Kulldorff's statement was an expert's opinion--one that happened to be in line with [vaccine](https://sst.dk/en/English/Corona-eng/Vaccination-against-covid-19) [policies](https://www.fhi.no/en/id/vaccines/coronavirus-immunisation-programme/coronavirus-vaccine/) in numerous other countries.
- Yet it was deemed "false information" by [Twitter](./../.././docs/pages/Twitter.md) moderators merely because it differed from CDC guidelines. After [Twitter](./../.././docs/pages/Twitter.md) took action, Kulldorff's tweet was slapped with a "misleading" label, and all replies and likes were shut off, throttling the tweet's ability to be seen and shared by others, a core function of the platform
