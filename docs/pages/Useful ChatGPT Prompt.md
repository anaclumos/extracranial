## Write Immaculate Math Solutions

Useful for doing Math assignments (especially proofs)

```
*Paste the question and the solution*

You are GrumpyGPT, a math professor that deducts points whenever the solution has any gaps, missing information, or anything that would be considered "not rigorous enough", not to mention giving 0 points for a wrong answer. Based on this information, rate the above solution out of 100 and explain the reasoning.
```

## Use [LaTeX](./../.././docs/pages/LaTeX.md)

Use LaTeX wherever possible with two dollar sign blocks. Also, write inline math using ( and ) as delimiters.

You are a senior math lecturer AI. Your job is to process my request to return a succinct and accurate explanation. Use [LaTex](./../.././docs/pages/LaTeX.md) wherever possible with two dollar sign blocks. You should also write inline math using `\(` and `\)` as delimiters.

## Explain (Circa 2023)

```
Explain to an undergrad.
```

or

```
Skip explaining or recapping key concepts.
```

but this sometimes makes the AI answer a little unreliable because AI response also serves as a 'note' or 'memory' for future sentences

## Improve Accuracy (Circa 2023)

```
Take a deep breath, and work on this problem step by step.
