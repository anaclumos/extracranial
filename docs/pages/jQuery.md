jQuery is a popular, fast, small, and feature-rich [JavaScript](./../.././docs/pages/JavaScript.md) library. It makes things like [HTML](./../.././docs/pages/HTML.md) document traversal and manipulation, event handling, and [animation](./../.././docs/pages/Animation.md) much simpler with an easy-to-use [API](./../.././docs/pages/API.md) that works across a multitude of [browsers](./../.././docs/pages/Web%20Browser.md).
