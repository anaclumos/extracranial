> Preemptive multitasking involves the use of an interrupt mechanism, which suspends the currently executing process and invokes a [scheduler](./../.././docs/pages/Scheduler.md) to determine which process should execute next. Therefore, all processes will get some [CPU](./../.././docs/pages/CPU.md) time at any given time. [Preemption (computing)](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preemption_(computing)#PREEMPTIVE>)

Antonym of [Cooperative Multitasking](./../.././docs/pages/Cooperative%20Multitasking.md).
