Technical debt is a metaphorical term used in software development that refers to the cost of delaying necessary software maintenance, updates, or improvements to prioritize other tasks, such as meeting deadlines or delivering new features. Just as financial debt incurs interest, technical debt also accrues interest in increased complexity, decreased productivity, and increased risk of errors or failures.

We always think **tech debt** is terrible. But as [Soojin Ro pointed out](https://soojin.ro/blog/technical-debt), we learn a thing in [Finance](./../.././docs/pages/Finance.md).

$$
\text{asset} = \text{equity} + \text{liability}
$$

Businesses intentionally create debts to boost liquidity. Similarly, you get a **functional code** right away by incurring a tech debt right now. This significantly reduces the [Time to Market](./../.././docs/pages/Time%20to%20Market.md), which is more important than brilliant engineering. Alas, your service must first **serve someone** for that elegant code to run!

$$
\text{Engine} \Leftrightarrow f(\text{resource}, ~\text{time}) \to \text{utility}
$$

[Engine Equation](./../.././docs/pages/Engine%20Equation.md) comes handy here.
An [engine](./../.././docs/pages/Engine.md) takes time (a type of resource) and assets to create utility. Interestingly, this [Engine Equation (Metapage)](./../.././docs/pages/Engine%20Equation%20%28Metapage%29.md) is a function that takes time. If you want to put in less value (help or time) right now, you need to pay it later. Therefore, incurring technical debt is an optimizing technique for the [engine](./../.././docs/pages/Engine.md) function equation by prioritizing time over other resources in the short term.

This approach is similar but different from [Service Shimmings](./../.././docs/pages/Service%20Shimming.md); faking a service until you make it. But what is the same is creating market value (liquidity of the service) before the tech is ready.
In that sense, **Tech Now Pay Later** might be better terminology.
