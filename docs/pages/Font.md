> In modern usage, with the advent of computer fonts, the term "font" has come to be used as a synonym for "typeface", although a typical typeface (or "font family") consists of several fonts. For instance, the typeface "Bauer Bodoni" (sample shown here) includes fonts "Roman" (or "Regular"), "Bold," and "Italic"; each of these exists in a variety of sizes. The term "font" is correctly applied to any of these alone but may be used loosely to refer to the whole typeface. Each style is in a separate digital "font file" when used on computers.
