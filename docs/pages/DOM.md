> The Document Object Model (DOM) is a cross-platform and language-independent interface that treats an XML or [HTML](./../.././docs/pages/HTML.md) document as a tree structure wherein each node is an object representing a part of the document. The DOM represents a document with a logical tree. Each branch of the tree ends in a node, and each node contains objects. DOM methods allow programmatic access to the tree; with them, one can change a document's structure, style, or content. Nodes can have event handlers attached to them. Once an event is triggered, the event handlers get executed. [Document Object Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model)
