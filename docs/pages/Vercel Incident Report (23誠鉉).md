I got blocked from Vercel under "violating fair use" with two projects: [lovearc.net](./../.././docs/pages/lovearc.net.md) and [hn.cho.sh](./../.././docs/pages/hn.cho.sh.md).

I got it resolved by deleting [lovearc.net](./../.././docs/pages/lovearc.net.md), but now I lean towards [Cloudflare Pages](./../.././docs/pages/Cloudflare%20Pages.md)

For comparison, this would cost \$9,600 with [Vercel](./../.././docs/pages/Vercel.md) and \$2,017 in [AWS](./../.././docs/pages/AWS.md) CloudFront.

## Update

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve been very transparent about all of work happening around usage controls and pricing at Vercel. So I&#39;d like to do that now.

The tl;dr of the feedback is: more visibility into usage and more ways to control spending. And I think I haven&#39;t done a job good about…
