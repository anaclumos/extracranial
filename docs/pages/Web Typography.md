> Web typography refers to using fonts on the World Wide Web. When [HTML](./../.././docs/pages/HTML.md) was first created, [font](./../.././docs/pages/Font.md) faces and styles were controlled exclusively by the settings of each [web browser](./../.././docs/pages/Web%20Browser.md). There was no mechanism for individual Web pages to control [font](./../.././docs/pages/Font.md) display until Netscape introduced the [font](./../.././docs/pages/Font.md) element in 1995, which was then standardized in the [HTML](./../.././docs/pages/HTML.md) 3.2 specification. However, the [font](./../.././docs/pages/Font.md) specified by the [font](./../.././docs/pages/Font.md) element had to be installed on the user's computer, or a fallback [font](./../.././docs/pages/Font.md), such as a [browser](./../.././docs/pages/Web%20Browser.md)'s default sans-serif or monospace [font](./../.././docs/pages/Font.md), would be used. The first Cascading Style Sheets specification was published in 1996 and provided the same capabilities. [Web typography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_typography)
