## [Prehistoric](./../.././docs/pages/Prehistoric.md)

Where would [hn.cho.sh](./../.././docs/pages/hn.cho.sh.md) lead us? An [AI](./../.././docs/pages/AI.md)-powered news portal? Reference: [일일일](./../.././docs/pages/%EC%9D%BC%EC%9D%BC%EC%9D%BC.md), [News Minimalist](./../.././docs/pages/News%20Minimalist.md). Would it eventually lead to a portal? Or should I remain as a newsletter? Would there be any other form?

## After some contemplation...

It should be **Super Long Range Radar**, **The Oracle's Eye**, **The ALL-SEER** that keeps you up to date on specific topics.

[AI](./../.././docs/pages/AI.md)-powered news portal can never be the answer; it should be a platform where people can proactively seek and search foreign intelligence.

### Imagine a workflow...

At [Karrot](./../.././docs/pages/Karrot.md), [scraping](./../.././docs/pages/Crawler.md) the news over the internet was a daily activity.

What if we can ask the **All-seer** to check for keywords [당근](./../.././docs/pages/Karrot.md) 캐롯 and [Karrot](./../.././docs/pages/Karrot.md) every day?

An example:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

At Simple Analytics, we use AI to detect if new articles on Hacker News or Google Alerts are relevant to our business.

We ask for a rating between 0-100 and why the article is getting that rating.

We send ourselves alerts when rating is 30+

### Themed Newsletters

What if we want to keep ourselves up to date on various topics but in a non-aggressive, [Anti-Tiktok](./../.././docs/pages/Anti-Tiktok.md) manner? Users can ask:

- Hey Heimdall, give me daily reports on **Hacker News** (the current [hn.cho.sh](./../.././docs/pages/hn.cho.sh.md) service)
- Hey Heimdall, give me daily reports on **TechCrunch**
- Hey Heimdall, give me daily reports on **대한민국 연예계 뉴스**
- Hey Heimdall, give me daily reports on **European Fashion Market**

Then Heimdall will give reports every day.
