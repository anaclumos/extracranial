## [Alexander Obenauer](./../.././docs/pages/Alexander%20Obenauer.md)

- [Mail Pilot](https://www.mailpilot.app/) is an [email](./../.././docs/pages/Mail.md) client that introduced new perspectives and useful features to [email](./../.././docs/pages/Mail.md) in 2012, such as reminders, which was later adopted by other apps as "snooze". After a record-breaking Kickstarter campaign, [Mail](./../.././docs/pages/Mail.md) Pilot went on to become the #1 paid app in the Mac [App Store](./../.././docs/pages/App%20Store.md) at launch. It is available today as a native app for [macOS](./../.././docs/pages/macOS.md), [iPadOS](./../.././docs/pages/iOS.md), and [iOS](./../.././docs/pages/iOS.md).
- [Throttle](https://throttlehq.com/) is a service that introduced sender-specific addresses in 2015 to give [email](./../.././docs/pages/Mail.md) receivers fine-grained oversight and control over the transactional and bulk [email](./../.././docs/pages/Mail.md) headed their way, and is often turned to as a home away from the inbox for less urgent [email](./../.././docs/pages/Mail.md).
