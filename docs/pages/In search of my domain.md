- I wanted the domain to be short and memorable. Some examples include:
  - procho.blog (used as a WordPress blog for a while)
  - cho.pro (I wasn't able to register it)
  - cho.dev (The price was too high, ~$800)
- I registered [cho.sh](./../.././docs/pages/Aldehyde.md) in 2018 and even experimented with GitHub Pages, but I did not want to use it at the moment for several reasons:
  - the word **chosh** was registered as a negative meaning in Urban Dictionary
  - I did not have any technical proficiency to satisfy my vision for a personal website
  - I wanted to use the domain finally when the tech was ready
- I used blog.chosunghyun.com or any variation of it
- From early 2022, I prepared to use [cho.sh](./../.././docs/pages/Aldehyde.md) after figuring that the Urban Dictionary chosh term was deleted due to spam & wrongful information
- Now, we all see I use the domain cho.sh!
- I sometimes think of golfing it further, something less than four characters, but all seems unlikely
