Cloud Native generations of software engineers refer to those developers who are familiar with and prefer cloud-native development practices and technologies. They have grown up in an era where [cloud computing](./../.././docs/pages/Cloud%20Computing.md) is the norm and take for granted the benefits that [cloud computing](./../.././docs/pages/Cloud%20Computing.md) offers, such as scalability, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness.

These software engineers are accustomed to deploying applications on cloud infrastructure, such as [AWS](./../.././docs/pages/AWS.md), instead of traditional [on-premise](./../.././docs/pages/On-Premise.md) infrastructure. They are comfortable building [Microservices Architecture](./../.././docs/pages/Microservices%20Architecture.md), containerization, and [automation](./../.././docs/pages/Automation.md) using tools like [Kubernetes](./../.././docs/pages/Kubernetes.md), [Docker](./../.././docs/pages/Docker.md), and Terraform.

Cloud Native software engineers are familiar with modern application design patterns and practices, such as DevOps, continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD), and [serverless](./../.././docs/pages/Serverless.md) computing. They leverage these practices to build applications that can be deployed and scaled quickly and efficiently in the cloud.

I am cloud-native, and [AI-native](./../.././docs/pages/AI-native.md), and that is my edge.
