> In computing, a symbolic link (also symlink or soft link) is a file whose purpose is to point to a file or directory (called the "target") by specifying a path to it. Symbolic links are supported by POSIX and by most Unix-like operating systems, such as FreeBSD, [Linux](./../.././docs/pages/Linux.md), and macOS. Limited support also exists in Windows 7 and Windows Vista, and to some degree in Windows 2000 and Windows XP in the form of shortcut files. Symlinks were already present by 1978 in minicomputer operating systems from DEC and in Data General's RDOS. [Symbolic link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_link)
