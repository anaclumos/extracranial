Server-side rendering (SSR) is a technique used in web development where web pages are generated on the server and sent to the client's [browser](./../.././docs/pages/Web%20Browser.md) as complete [HTML](./../.././docs/pages/HTML.md) documents. In SSR, the server processes the requested page and dynamically generates the [HTML](./../.././docs/pages/HTML.md) content, considering any data or logic required to render the page.
