> Jest is a JavaScript testing framework built on top of Jasmine and maintained by [Meta](./../.././docs/pages/Meta%20%28Company%29.md) (formerly [Facebook](./../.././docs/pages/Facebook.md)). Christoph Nakazawa designed and made it with a focus on simplicity and support for large web applications. It works with projects using Babel, [TypeScript](./../.././docs/pages/TypeScript.md), [Node.js](./../.././docs/pages/Node.js.md), [React](./../.././docs/pages/React.md), Angular, Vue.js, and [Svelte](./../.././docs/pages/Svelte.md). Jest doesn't require a lot of configuration for first-time users of a testing framework. [Jest (JavaScript framework)](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jest_(JavaScript_framework)>)
