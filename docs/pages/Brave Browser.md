Brave is a free and open-source [web browser](./../.././docs/pages/Web%20Browser.md) that is focused on privacy. It is based on [Chromium](./../.././docs/pages/Chromium.md), the same technology used by [Google](./../.././docs/pages/Google.md) for [Chrome](./../.././docs/pages/Chrome.md) and [Microsoft](./../.././docs/pages/Microsoft.md) for [Edge](./../.././docs/pages/Edge.md). Brave automatically blocks some ads and website trackers in its default settings. It also blocks third-party data storage, [browser](./../.././docs/pages/Web%20Browser.md) fingerprinting, and some malware and phishing attempts.

However, Brave introduced more bugs than [Chrome](./../.././docs/pages/Chrome.md).
