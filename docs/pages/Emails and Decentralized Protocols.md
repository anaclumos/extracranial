### [After self-hosting my email for twenty-three years, I have thrown in the towel. The oligopoly has won.](https://cfenollosa.com/blog/after-self-hosting-my-email-for-twenty-three-years-i-have-thrown-in-the-towel-the-oligopoly-has-won.html)

- [Email](./../.././docs/pages/Mail.md) is now an oligopoly, a service gatekept by a few big companies which do not follow net neutrality principles.
- [Google](./../.././docs/pages/Google.md) has half a billion results for "[my email goes directly to spam](https://www.google.com/search?q=my+email+goes+directly+to+spam)
- [email](./../.././docs/pages/Mail.md) servers run bayesian filtering algorithms, which protect you, and most spam doesn't reach your inbox.
- Big Tech deliberately nerfs [email](./../.././docs/pages/Mail.md) deliverability.
- if you want to build services on top of the [email](./../.././docs/pages/Mail.md), you have to pay for an [email](./../.././docs/pages/Mail.md)-sending [API](./../.././docs/pages/API.md) which others in the industry have blessed. One of **them**.

### [Self-Hosted email is the hardest it's ever been, but also the easiest.](https://vadosware.io/post/its-never-been-easier-or-harder-to-self-host-email/)

- Deliverability may be troubled, but running your [email](./../.././docs/pages/Mail.md) server has never been easier. Struggling with `postfix` and `dovecot` configuration, semantics, and architecture isn't the only way to start using the [email](./../.././docs/pages/Mail.md) you control.
- You don't have to `postfix` + `dovecot` in 2022.
- An excellent recommendation from the original discussion on [Hacker News](./../.././docs/pages/Hacker%20News.md) was to use [ImprovMX](https://improvmx.com) as an outgoing [email](./../.././docs/pages/Mail.md) server.

- [Alexander Obenauer](./../.././docs/pages/Alexander%20Obenauer.md). My career began with [Reimagining Emails](./../.././docs/pages/Reimagining%20Emails.md) and finding ways to build that vision on top of the existing [email](./../.././docs/pages/Mail.md) protocols.
