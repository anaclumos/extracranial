- [Letter](./../.././docs/pages/Mail.md) to Mr. [Matt Rickard](./../.././docs/pages/Matt%20Rickard.md) on 2022-10-03

Dear Mr. Rickard,

Awesome article. I want to give one good example of Screenshots-as-an-[API](./../.././docs/pages/API.md).

Unlike the Western market, the [Korean](./../.././docs/pages/%ED%95%9C%EB%AF%BC%EC%A1%B1.md) music market is heavily independent.
Although YouTube Music has gobbled up the market cap quite significantly, most people still use [Korean](./../.././docs/pages/%ED%95%9C%EB%AF%BC%EC%A1%B1.md) services to listen to music, primarily due to copyright issues for foreign Music services (they don't have [Korean](./../.././docs/pages/%ED%95%9C%EB%AF%BC%EC%A1%B1.md) songs).
That being said, Spotify and [Apple](./../.././docs/pages/Apple.md) Music have a market penetration of next to nothing.

There are two behemoths in [Korea](./../.././docs/pages/%EB%8C%80%ED%95%9C%EB%AF%BC%EA%B5%AD.md), [Naver](./../.././docs/pages/Naver.md), and [Kakao](./../.././docs/pages/Kakao.md).
[Naver](./../.././docs/pages/Naver.md) services as the omnipotent search [engine](./../.././docs/pages/Engine.md) for [Korea](./../.././docs/pages/%EB%8C%80%ED%95%9C%EB%AF%BC%EA%B5%AD.md) (bigger market cap than [Google](./../.././docs/pages/Google.md) [Korea](./../.././docs/pages/%EB%8C%80%ED%95%9C%EB%AF%BC%EA%B5%AD.md)) and [Kakao](./../.././docs/pages/Kakao.md) services as an almighty chatting app (more than 95% of [Koreans](./../.././docs/pages/%ED%95%9C%EB%AF%BC%EC%A1%B1.md) use it).
They always fight each other for market superiority.

[Kakao](./../.././docs/pages/Kakao.md) currently operates the #1 music streaming service, Melon.
In 2019, [Naver](./../.././docs/pages/Naver.md) released a new music streaming service, Vibe, akin to Spotify in terms of interface and functionality.
At the time, Melon had a notorious lock-in for music playlists to deter users from escaping to other platforms.
Melon had no APIs, SSOs, or Access Tokens, not to mention prohibiting all sorts of copy-paste and data extraction.

[Naver](./../.././docs/pages/Naver.md) eventually released a feature where users could screenshot the playlist to port out playlists from melon.
It was a clever move that did not violate any law restrictions or terms of use.
I attached a translated article and video for you.
The video is in [Korean](./../.././docs/pages/%ED%95%9C%EB%AF%BC%EC%A1%B1.md), but it's a 30-second visual tutorial video, so you'll get the feeling.

The [Korean](./../.././docs/pages/%ED%95%9C%EB%AF%BC%EC%A1%B1.md) tech market has these random unheard intriguing stories.
I'm at @anaclumos on [GitHub](./../.././docs/pages/GitHub.md), [Twitter](./../.././docs/pages/Twitter.md), and any other platform.
Hope we can keep in touch.

Best Regards,
Sunghyun Cho
