Given a [database](./../.././docs/pages/Database.md), how interconnected is the [database](./../.././docs/pages/Database.md)?

## Key Idea

Given $n$ nodes, there can be $n(n-1) \over 2$ total possible links if every single node is connected to the other. How many links exist compared to that fully-linked [database](./../.././docs/pages/Database.md)?

$$
\text{Link Coefficient} = {\text{Existing Number of Links} \over \text{Total Possible Number of Links}}
$$

For example, as of [2023-02-16](./../.././docs/journals/2023-02-16.md), [Aldehyde](./../.././docs/pages/Aldehyde.md) has a 0.592% of Link Coefficient.
