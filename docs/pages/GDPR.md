> The General Data Protection Regulation ([EU](./../.././docs/pages/EU.md)) (GDPR) is a regulation in [EU](./../.././docs/pages/EU.md) law on data protection and privacy in the [European Union](./../.././docs/pages/EU.md) ([EU](./../.././docs/pages/EU.md)) and the European [Economic](./../.././docs/pages/Economy.md) Area (EEA). The GDPR is an important component of [EU](./../.././docs/pages/EU.md) privacy law and of human rights law, in particular Article 8(1) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the [European Union](./../.././docs/pages/EU.md). It also addresses the transfer of personal data outside the [EU](./../.././docs/pages/EU.md) and EEA areas. The GDPR's primary aim is to enhance individuals' control and rights over their personal data and to simplify the regulatory environment for international business. Superseding the Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC, the regulation contains provisions and requirements related to the processing of personal data of individuals (formally called data subjects in the GDPR) who are located in the EEA, and applies to any enterprise--regardless of its location and the data subjects' citizenship or residence--that is processing the personal information of individuals inside the EEA.
