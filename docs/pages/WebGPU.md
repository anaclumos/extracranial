### [Use.GPU Docs - Intro](https://usegpu.live/)

- Use.[GPU](./../.././docs/pages/GPU.md) is a set of **declarative, reactive WebGPU legos**. Compose live graphs, layouts, meshes, and shaders, on the fly
- It's a **stand-alone [TypeScript](./../.././docs/pages/TypeScript.md)+[Rust](./../.././docs/pages/Rust.md)/[WASM](./../.././docs/pages/WebAssembly.md) library** with its own [React](./../.././docs/pages/React.md)-like run-time. If you're familiar with [React](./../.././docs/pages/React.md), you will feel right at home
- It has a built-in **[shader](./../.././docs/pages/Shader.md) [linker](./../.././docs/pages/Link%20%28Computer%20Systems%29.md) and binding generator**, which means a lot of the tedium of common [GPU](./../.././docs/pages/GPU.md) programming is eliminated without compromising on flexibility
