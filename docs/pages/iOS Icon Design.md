```
Create an iOS app icon based on this image.

Icon should fill the entire image. Apply no icon mask or border radius.
Use vibrant Display P3 colors.
Image should be square 1024x1024 with no transparency.
Respect the golden ratio (1:1.618). Essential content (logos, visuals) should be within ~80% to ~85% of the icon's width and height.
Embrace simplicity. Prefer a simple backgroun that puts the emphasis on the primary image.
Prefer vector graphics over photos or screenshots, which lose clarity at small sizes.
```
