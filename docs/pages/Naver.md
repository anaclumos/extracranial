> Naver (Hangul: 네이버) is a [Korean](./../.././docs/pages/%EB%8C%80%ED%95%9C%EB%AF%BC%EA%B5%AD.md) online platform operated by the Naver Corporation. It debuted in 1999 as the first web portal in [Korea](./../.././docs/pages/%EB%8C%80%ED%95%9C%EB%AF%BC%EA%B5%AD.md) to develop and use its search [engine](./../.././docs/pages/Engine.md). It was also the world's first operator to introduce the comprehensive search feature, which compiles search results from various categories and presents them on a single page. Naver has since added many new services ranging from basic features such as [e-mail](./../.././docs/pages/Mail.md) and news to the world's first online Q&A platform, Knowledge iN.
