[USDZ](./../.././docs/pages/USDZ.md) and [glTF](./../.././docs/pages/glTF.md) are two [3D](./../.././docs/pages/3D.md) file formats used for different purposes. [USDZ](./../.././docs/pages/USDZ.md) is a subset of USD, created by Pixar and operated by [Apple](./../.././docs/pages/Apple.md) for [iOS](./../.././docs/pages/iOS.md) [Augmented Reality](./../.././docs/pages/Augmented%20Reality.md) applications. It is a zip file with USD and image files. [glTF](./../.././docs/pages/glTF.md) is a transmission format for [3D](./../.././docs/pages/3D.md) assets well suited to the web and mobile devices. It removes unimportant data for efficient support display and employs compression algorithms to reduce file size.

[USDZ](./../.././docs/pages/USDZ.md) has some limitations compared to [glTF](./../.././docs/pages/glTF.md), such as no geometry-specific compression, texture channel packing, and zip compression feature. However, it may have some advantages in terms of [interoperability](./../.././docs/pages/Interoperability.md) and scalability with other USD files.

[Apple](./../.././docs/pages/Apple.md) uses [USDZ](./../.././docs/pages/USDZ.md) for [iOS](./../.././docs/pages/iOS.md) [Augmented Reality](./../.././docs/pages/Augmented%20Reality.md) applications, but [Android](./../.././docs/pages/Android.md) does not support [USDZ](./../.././docs/pages/USDZ.md) yet. [Android](./../.././docs/pages/Android.md) has its equivalents, [glTF](./../.././docs/pages/glTF.md) and GLB, which are more suitable for web and mobile devices. However, it is possible to convert [USDZ](./../.././docs/pages/USDZ.md) and [glTF](./../.././docs/pages/glTF.md) using tools like Reality Converter. Also, there may be differences in rendering quality and tracking performance between [Apple](./../.././docs/pages/Apple.md) and [Android](./../.././docs/pages/Android.md) devices when using [Augmented Reality](./../.././docs/pages/Augmented%20Reality.md).
