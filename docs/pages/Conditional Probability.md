In [Probability](./../.././docs/pages/Probability.md),

In the real world, probabilities are not straightforward, like $P  \rightarrow Q$.
Therefore we translate into $P(B|A) \approx 1$. If $A$ happens, then B is most likely to happen. This defines as

$$
P(B|A) = {P(A \cap B) \over P(A)}
$$

This means

$$
{P(A \cap B)} = P(B|A) P(A)
$$

$P(B|A)$ is the **likelihood** and $P(A)$ is the **prior**.
