> The canvas element is part of HTML5 and allows for dynamic, scriptable rendering of 2D shapes and [bitmap images](./../.././docs/pages/Bitmap%20Graphic.md). It is a low level, procedural model that updates a [bitmap](./../.././docs/pages/Bitmap%20Graphic.md). HTML5 Canvas also helps in making 2D games. While the HTML5 canvas offers its own 2D drawing [API](./../.././docs/pages/API.md), it also supports the WebGL [API](./../.././docs/pages/API.md) to allow [3D](./../.././docs/pages/3D.md) rendering with OpenGL ES.
