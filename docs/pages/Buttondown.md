> Buttondown is a small, elegant tool for producing [newsletters](./../.././docs/pages/Newsletter.md). The minimalist interface makes it easy for you to write great [emails](./../.././docs/pages/Mail.md); the [automation](./../.././docs/pages/Automation.md) acts like the editorial assistant you wish you had by checking for typos, broken links, or distorted images; the portable subscription widget makes it easy to grow your audience from wherever you host your site. And then Buttondown gets out of your way! Buttondown's focus is on pragmatism over richness; it's not the most robust application you've ever used, but it may be the most delightful.
