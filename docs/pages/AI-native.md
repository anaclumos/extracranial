Especially with the emergence of [ChatGPT](./../.././docs/pages/ChatGPT.md).

[AI](./../.././docs/pages/AI.md)-native refers to developing and deploying [artificial intelligence](./../.././docs/pages/AI.md) ([AI](./../.././docs/pages/AI.md)) technologies in a way native to the cloud, leveraging the principles and practices of [cloud-native](./../.././docs/pages/Cloud-Native.md) development. It uses [cloud computing](./../.././docs/pages/Cloud%20Computing.md) infrastructure, services, and tools to build, train, and deploy [AI](./../.././docs/pages/AI.md) models.

[AI](./../.././docs/pages/AI.md)-native systems are designed to leverage [cloud computing](./../.././docs/pages/Cloud%20Computing.md) resources for data storage, processing, and analysis. They typically use cloud-based services such as data lakes, data warehouses, and analytics platforms to store and manage large volumes of data. They also use cloud-based tools such as [machine learning](./../.././docs/pages/ML.md) ([ML](./../.././docs/pages/ML.md)) frameworks, [natural language processing](./../.././docs/pages/Natural%20Language%20Processing.md) ([NLP](./../.././docs/pages/Natural%20Language%20Processing.md)) services, and computer vision APIs to develop and train [AI](./../.././docs/pages/AI.md) models.

In an [AI](./../.././docs/pages/AI.md)-native approach, the [AI](./../.././docs/pages/AI.md) models are typically built and trained using large amounts of data from various sources. This data is often stored in the cloud and can be accessed and processed by [AI](./../.././docs/pages/AI.md) models using cloud-based services and tools. In addition, [AI](./../.././docs/pages/AI.md) models are often deployed in the cloud, which can be scaled up or down to handle changing workloads.

An [AI](./../.././docs/pages/AI.md)-native approach's benefits include faster [Time to Market](./../.././docs/pages/Time%20to%20Market.md), increased scalability and availability, and improved cost-effectiveness. However, it also requires specialized [data science](./../.././docs/pages/Data%20Science.md), [ML](./../.././docs/pages/ML.md), and [cloud computing](./../.././docs/pages/Cloud%20Computing.md) skills. In addition, it presents challenges around managing large volumes of data, ensuring data privacy and security, and avoiding bias in [AI](./../.././docs/pages/AI.md) models.
