> AMP (originally an acronym for Accelerated Mobile Pages) is an open-source HTML framework developed by the AMP Open Source [Project](./../.././docs/pages/Project.md). [Google](./../.././docs/pages/Google.md) created it as a competitor to [Facebook](./../.././docs/pages/Facebook.md) Instant Articles and [Apple](./../.././docs/pages/Apple.md) News. AMP is optimized for mobile web browsing and intended to help webpages load faster. AMP pages may be cached by a [CDN](./../.././docs/pages/CDN.md), such as [Microsoft](./../.././docs/pages/Microsoft.md) [Bing](./../.././docs/pages/Bing.md) or [Cloudflare](./../.././docs/pages/Cloudflare.md)'s AMP caches, which allows pages to be served more quickly.

Uses [WorkerDOM](./../.././docs/pages/WorkerDOM.md) under the hood.
