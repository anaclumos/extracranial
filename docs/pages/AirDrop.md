AirDrop is a feature in [iOS](./../.././docs/pages/iOS.md) and [macOS](./../.././docs/pages/macOS.md) that lets you wirelessly share files between nearby [Apple](./../.././docs/pages/Apple.md) devices. AirDrop uses [Bluetooth](./../.././docs/pages/Bluetooth.md) low energy to discover and negotiate connections and point-to-point Wi-Fi to transfer information. You can use AirDrop to share photos, videos, websites, and locations between devices that are up to about 30 feet apart. AirDrop was introduced in Mac [OS X](./../.././docs/pages/macOS.md) Lion ([Mac OS X](./../.././docs/pages/macOS.md) 10.7) and [iOS](./../.././docs/pages/iOS.md) 7. It requires [iOS](./../.././docs/pages/iOS.md) 7, [iPadOS](./../.././docs/pages/iOS.md) 13, or [OS X](./../.././docs/pages/macOS.md) 10.10, or later. Both Wi-Fi and [Bluetooth](./../.././docs/pages/Bluetooth.md) must be turned on to use AirDrop. AirDrop is generally considered secure as long as users take precautions such as setting it to "Contacts Only" or "Receiving Off." [Apple](./../.././docs/pages/Apple.md) has implemented several security features to ensure that data transfers are private and secure.
