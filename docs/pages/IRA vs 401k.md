1. Traditional IRA:
   - Pre-[tax](./../.././docs/pages/Tax.md) Contributions: The money you put into a Traditional IRA is typically [tax](./../.././docs/pages/Tax.md)-deductible in the year of the contribution.
   - [Taxes](./../.././docs/pages/Tax.md) on Withdrawals: The money you withdraw during retirement is taxed as regular income.
   - Required Minimum Distributions: Once you reach age 72, you are required to start taking minimum distributions from your account, whether you need the money or not.
   - Early Withdrawal Penalty: If you withdraw funds before age 59 1/2, you typically have to pay a 10% penalty in addition to regular income [tax](./../.././docs/pages/Tax.md), although there are certain exceptions.
2. Roth IRA:
   - After-[tax](./../.././docs/pages/Tax.md) Contributions: The money you put into a Roth IRA has already been taxed, so you get no [tax](./../.././docs/pages/Tax.md) deduction for contributions.
   - [Tax](./../.././docs/pages/Tax.md)-free Withdrawals: The money you withdraw during retirement is generally [tax](./../.././docs/pages/Tax.md)-free, as long as you're at least 59 1/2 and the account has been open for at least five years.
   - No Required Minimum Distributions: Unlike a traditional IRA, a Roth IRA has no mandatory distributions during the lifetime of the original owner.
   - Early Withdrawal Flexibility: You can withdraw your original contributions (but not any earnings) at any time without penalty or [tax](./../.././docs/pages/Tax.md). For earnings, regular rules apply.
3. [401(k)](./../.././docs/pages/401k.md):
   - Pre-[tax](./../.././docs/pages/Tax.md) or Roth Contributions: Depending on your plan, you may have the option to make pre-[tax](./../.././docs/pages/Tax.md) contributions (like a traditional IRA) or after-[tax](./../.././docs/pages/Tax.md) contributions (like a Roth IRA). Some plans even offer both.
   - [Taxes](./../.././docs/pages/Tax.md) on Withdrawals: Like an IRA, the money you withdraw during retirement from a traditional [401(k)](./../.././docs/pages/401k.md) is taxed as regular income. Withdrawals from a Roth [401(k)](./../.././docs/pages/401k.md) are [tax](./../.././docs/pages/Tax.md)-free.
   - Employer Match: Many employers will match a portion of your [401(k)](./../.././docs/pages/401k.md) contributions, which can significantly increase the value of the account.
   - Higher Contribution Limits: The annual contribution limit for a [401(k)](./../.././docs/pages/401k.md) is much higher than for an IRA.
   - Early Withdrawal Penalty: Similar to an IRA, there's typically a 10% penalty for withdrawing funds before age 59 1/2, with certain exceptions.
