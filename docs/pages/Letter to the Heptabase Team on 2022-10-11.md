- [Letter](./../.././docs/pages/Mail.md) to the [Heptabase](./../.././docs/pages/Heptabase.md) Team on [2022-10-11](./../.././docs/journals/2022-10-11.md)

> On [Heptabase](./../.././docs/pages/Heptabase.md) and its Developer Ecosystem

Dear Mr. Chan,

很高興見到你! I am Sunghyun Cho, a computer scientist based in [LA](./../.././docs/pages/Los%20Angeles.md) and [Seoul](./../.././docs/pages/%EC%84%9C%EC%9A%B8.md). I am also a contributor to GoogleChrome/web.dev, [Facebook](./../.././docs/pages/Facebook.md)/[docusaurus](./../.././docs/pages/Docusaurus.md), [Vercel](./../.././docs/pages/Vercel.md)/[Satori](./../.././docs/pages/Satori.md), Logseq/Logseq, Etc. I came across [Heptabase](./../.././docs/pages/Heptabase.md) and wanted to speak with you!

First of all, I want to show my support and love ❤ towards anyone contributing the rethinking the Extracranials (-- my terminology of external thinking support software)!

- Creating Next-gen Digital Brains https://cho.sh/w/D8FB8E

As you can see on my website, I am heavily obsessed with Digital Brains on the web. My entire research page (https://cho.sh/r/) runs on heavily customized [Obsidian](./../.././docs/pages/Obsidian.md), [Nota](./../.././docs/pages/Nota.md), and [Docusaurus](./../.././docs/pages/Docusaurus.md), serving as my daily note-taking platform after figuring out [Logseq](./../.././docs/pages/Logseq.md) Publish, [Obsidian](./../.././docs/pages/Obsidian.md) Publish, and Roam Garden did not suffice my needs.

I am recently experimenting with Visual Thinking tools (okso.app was an interesting one), and you would know that there aren't any open-source/open-data/developer-friendly services in the market yet. As much as I hope [Heptabase](./../.././docs/pages/Heptabase.md) becomes an Open Core model (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-core_model), it doesn't seem that's feasible shortly, considering there is still a [paywall](./../.././docs/pages/Fiercely%20Overpriced.md) upfront. However, I would love to explore [Heptabase](./../.././docs/pages/Heptabase.md)'s native APIs and endless possibilities 🚀

Now I would like to ask: Would there be some sort of... in the near future (within six months)?

- [Markdown](./../.././docs/pages/Markdown.md)-Wikilink import/export
- [API](./../.././docs/pages/API.md) support ([Notion](./../.././docs/pages/Notion.md)-like?)
- Handwriting/Pen Support ([iOS](./../.././docs/pages/iOS.md) App)?
- Any open-source works
- Free-to-use Service
- [Extension](./../.././docs/pages/WebExtension.md) APIs

P.S. I love your work and blog and have always enjoyed reading your English/Taiwanese articles. I never knew Taiwanese → English translation evolved so well! Anyways, if you need any [Korean](./../.././docs/pages/%ED%95%9C%EA%B5%AD%EC%96%B4.md) 🇰🇷 translation support or anything I can help with, I'm more than happy to! I know a community of 900+ individuals interested in [Heptabase](./../.././docs/pages/Heptabase.md) & Visual Thinking.

感謝您, and I look forward to your response! 🇹🇼🇰🇷🇺🇸

敬祝 順利

(I just studied Taiwanese Business [Letter](./../.././docs/pages/Mail.md) 101 -- Apologies if these are wrong 😅)
