> Write once, run anywhere (WORA), or sometimes Write once, run everywhere (WORE), was a 1995 slogan created by Sun Microsystems to illustrate the cross-platform benefits of the [Java](./../.././docs/pages/Java.md) language. Ideally, a [Java](./../.././docs/pages/Java.md) program could be developed on any device, compiled into standard bytecode, and be expected to run on any device equipped with a [Java](./../.././docs/pages/Java.md) virtual machine (JVM). Installing a JVM or [Java](./../.././docs/pages/Java.md) interpreter on chips, apparatus, or software packages became an industry standard practice.
