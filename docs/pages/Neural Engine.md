### [hollance/neural-engine: Everything we know about the Apple Neural Engine (ANE)](https://github.com/hollance/neural-engine)

- The [Apple](./../.././docs/pages/Apple.md) [Neural Engine](./../.././docs/pages/Neural%20Engine.md) (or ANE) is a type of [NPU](./../.././docs/pages/NPU.md), which stands for Neural Processing Unit. It's like a [GPU](./../.././docs/pages/GPU.md), but instead of accelerating [graphics](./../.././docs/pages/Graphics.md), an [NPU](./../.././docs/pages/NPU.md) accelerates neural network operations such as convolutions and matrix multiplies
