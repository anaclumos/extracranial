macOS is a proprietary, graphical operating system ([OS](./../.././docs/pages/OS.md)) that powers [Apple](./../.././docs/pages/Apple.md)'s Mac computers. It's the primary [OS](./../.././docs/pages/OS.md) for [Apple](./../.././docs/pages/Apple.md)'s Mac computers. macOS comes preloaded on all new [Apple](./../.././docs/pages/Apple.md) Macintosh computers. It's the second most widely used desktop [OS](./../.././docs/pages/OS.md), after [Microsoft](./../.././docs/pages/Microsoft.md) Windows and ahead of [Linux](./../.././docs/pages/Linux.md). macOS was the first mainstream [OS](./../.././docs/pages/OS.md) to feature a graphical user interface and mouse input. The macOS desktop interface is called the Finder. It was introduced in 2001 as the successor to the classic Mac [OS](./../.././docs/pages/OS.md). The first desktop version, Mac [OS](./../.././docs/pages/OS.md) X 10.0, was released in March 2001. macOS is designed specifically for the hardware it runs on. It lets you do things you can't with other computers. It comes with a suite of beautifully designed apps.
