[Old Someday](./../.././docs/pages/Old%20Someday.md) [Project](./../.././docs/pages/Project.md). Ideated during [Person 648442](./../.././docs/pages/Person%20648442.md)

Like [Texts (Service)](./../.././docs/pages/Texts%20%28Service%29.md), it pulls from all the sources and posts to all the sources--LinkedIn, Twitter, [Insta](./../.././docs/pages/Instagram.md), [Facebook](./../.././docs/pages/Facebook.md), etc. It's similar to [Jumpsite](./../.././docs/pages/Jumpsite.md), but not the same; you never need to escape the website.

Doesn't it bother to juggle between different social media apps? I have the solution for you. Introducing '[One and only](./../.././docs/pages/One%20and%20only.md),' the ultimate social media app that combines all your social media accounts, including [Facebook](./../.././docs/pages/Facebook.md), [Instagram](./../.././docs/pages/Instagram.md), Reddit, and Twitter, into one unified feed. Post only once; it will shoot to all of the platforms. Your unified feed will have posts from all media, subreddits, and groups. In addition, a unified inbox will aggregate all your direct messages into one place.

The problem I am solving is the hassle of managing multiple social media accounts and juggling different communication channels. '[One and only](./../.././docs/pages/One%20and%20only.md)' will simplify our digital life by combining your social media accounts into one unified platform, including [Facebook](./../.././docs/pages/Facebook.md), [Instagram](./../.././docs/pages/Instagram.md), Reddit, and Twitter. Our app saves you time and effort by simultaneously posting your content across multiple platforms and features a unified inbox that gathers all your direct messages in one place.

I will change the world by creating a **[Super App](./../.././docs/pages/Super%20App.md)** in the US. China has a highly successful [Super App](./../.././docs/pages/Super%20App.md) ([WeChat](./../.././docs/pages/WeChat.md)) that combines various functionalities such as messaging, social media, [e-commerce](./../.././docs/pages/e-commerce.md), and mobile payments into a single app. Super Apps do not exist in the US. '[One and only](./../.././docs/pages/One%20and%20only.md)' is my first attempt to create a [Super App](./../.././docs/pages/Super%20App.md) in the US by combining multiple social media platforms into a single app. As the app grows and expands, it could become a [Super App](./../.././docs/pages/Super%20App.md) and transform how Americans manage their online presence.
