[Korea](./../.././docs/pages/%EB%8C%80%ED%95%9C%EB%AF%BC%EA%B5%AD.md)'s fertility rate has dropped to a new low of 0.78, the lowest in the OECD and possibly the world. Several key factors explain this persistence of low fertility in [Korea](./../.././docs/pages/%EB%8C%80%ED%95%9C%EB%AF%BC%EA%B5%AD.md). Some of these factors include robust segmentation of the labor market, changing attitudes towards marriage and children, insufficient support to secure transition to adulthood, job insecurity, and high cost of housing and education.
