Some time ago, I wrote that companies are [economic](./../.././docs/pages/Economy.md) [engine](./../.././docs/pages/Engine.md) of some sort. Engines, however, are difficult to visualize and internalize. So a better analogy will be that **companies are [economic](./../.././docs/pages/Economy.md) organisms**. That is, how are you going to feed the company? Where will you scout for food? How will you defecate?
