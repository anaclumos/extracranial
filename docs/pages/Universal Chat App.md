A universal chat is a single, centralized chat service or platform that every internet user is part of, much like a ubiquitous social media network or [email](./../.././docs/pages/Mail.md) service. It facilitates communication among all its users without them needing to be on separate platforms or use different applications.

## Asia

Asia has multiple universal chats, depending on the region.

1. **[WeChat](./../.././docs/pages/WeChat.md) (China)**. Developed by Tencent, [WeChat](./../.././docs/pages/WeChat.md) is more than just a messaging app; it's a complete social ecosystem. As of my last knowledge update in September 2021, [WeChat](./../.././docs/pages/WeChat.md) was the most popular app in China, with over a billion active users. [WeChat](./../.././docs/pages/WeChat.md) offers features like text messaging, voice, and video calls, a news feed (similar to [Facebook](./../.././docs/pages/Facebook.md)'s), [mini-programs](./../.././docs/pages/Mini%20App.md) (small apps that run within [WeChat](./../.././docs/pages/WeChat.md) itself), and WeChat Pay, allowing users to make digital payments.
2. **[KakaoTalk](./../.././docs/pages/KakaoTalk.md) ([Korea](./../.././docs/pages/%EB%8C%80%ED%95%9C%EB%AF%BC%EA%B5%AD.md))**. Developed by [Kakao](./../.././docs/pages/Kakao.md) Corporation, [KakaoTalk](./../.././docs/pages/KakaoTalk.md) is a free mobile instant messaging application for smartphones with free text and free call features. It is the dominant messaging app in [Korea](./../.././docs/pages/%EB%8C%80%ED%95%9C%EB%AF%BC%EA%B5%AD.md), used by a vast majority of smartphone users in the country. In addition to messaging and calling, it offers various services such as digital payments ([KakaoPay](./../.././docs/pages/KakaoPay.md)), a news feed, music streaming, and even taxi-hailing.
3. **[Line](./../.././docs/pages/Line.md) ([Japan](./../.././docs/pages/%EC%9D%BC%EB%B3%B8.md))**. Developed by [Naver](./../.././docs/pages/Naver.md), a [Korean](./../.././docs/pages/%EB%8C%80%ED%95%9C%EB%AF%BC%EA%B5%AD.md) search portal, Line is widely used in [Japan](./../.././docs/pages/%EC%9D%BC%EB%B3%B8.md), [Taiwan](./../.././docs/pages/%EB%8C%80%EB%A7%8C.md), and Thailand. In addition to messaging and free calls, it includes a timeline to share photos, statuses, and comments. It also has Line Pay for payments and additional features like Line Music, Line Taxi, and various games.

## Europe

In the [EU](./../.././docs/pages/EU.md), it's slightly more complicated. Most people use WhatsApp.

1. **WhatsApp**. Owned by [Facebook](./../.././docs/pages/Meta%20%28Company%29.md), WhatsApp is a free messaging app available for [Android](./../.././docs/pages/Android.md) and other smartphones. It uses the internet to let you message and call friends and family, so you don't have to pay for every message or call.
2. **[Facebook Messenger](./../.././docs/pages/Facebook%20Messenger.md)**. Also owned by [Facebook](./../.././docs/pages/Meta%20%28Company%29.md), [Messenger](./../.././docs/pages/Facebook%20Messenger.md) is a messaging platform that allows for text messages, voice calls, and video calls to people on the [Facebook](./../.././docs/pages/Facebook.md) platform.
3. **Viber**. Owned by the [Japanese](./../.././docs/pages/%EC%9D%BC%EB%B3%B8.md) company Rakuten, Viber is a free messaging and calling app that provides a secure connection, high-quality calls, and the ability to send texts, photos, and videos.

## [U.S.](./../.././docs/pages/United%20States%20of%20America.md)

In the Americas, there is no such universal chat app. Younger generations use [iMessage](./../.././docs/pages/iMessage.md), while elderlies use WhatsApp. Or often, everyone sticks to texting.

1. **[iMessage](./../.././docs/pages/iMessage.md)**. This is a built-in messaging service on [Apple](./../.././docs/pages/Apple.md) devices, including iPhones, iPads, and Macs. It supports text messages, photos, videos, and other types of content. However, it only works between [Apple](./../.././docs/pages/Apple.md) devices, which is a limitation if you're trying to communicate with someone who uses an [Android](./../.././docs/pages/Android.md) phone or a Windows PC.

## Protocol Propositions

On the **direct messages** aspect,

- [Matrix Network](./../.././docs/pages/Matrix%20Network.md). Used by [Beeper](./../.././docs/pages/Beeper.md). [Beeper](./../.././docs/pages/Beeper.md) aims to build a [Matrix](./../.././docs/pages/Matrix%20Network.md) bridge for all social networks.
- [MLS](./../.././docs/pages/MLS.md). Backed by [Google](./../.././docs/pages/Google.md) and IETF.
- [RCS](./../.././docs/pages/RCS.md). Backed by [Google](./../.././docs/pages/Google.md) and Samsung.

More on the **social network** aspect,

- [AT protocol](./../.././docs/pages/AT%20protocol.md). Initially proposed by Jack Dorsey from [Twitter](./../.././docs/pages/Twitter.md), but after the [Musk-Twitter Incident](./../.././docs/pages/Musk-Twitter%20Incident.md), Dorsey founded [Bluesky](./../.././docs/pages/Bluesky.md). [AT Protocol](./../.././docs/pages/AT%20protocol.md) is actively maintained by [Bluesky](./../.././docs/pages/Bluesky.md).
- [ActivityPub](./../.././docs/pages/ActivityPub.md) protocol: Backed by [Threads (Service)](./../.././docs/pages/Threads%20%28Service%29.md) and [Mastodon](./../.././docs/pages/Mastodon.md).

## Connections: [Super App](./../.././docs/pages/Super%20App.md)
