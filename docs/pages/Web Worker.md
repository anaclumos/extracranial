> A web worker, as defined by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG), is a JavaScript script executed from an [HTML](./../.././docs/pages/HTML.md) page that runs in the background, independently of scripts that may also have been executed from the same [HTML](./../.././docs/pages/HTML.md) page. Web workers are often able to utilize multi-core CPUs more effectively. [Web worker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_worker)
