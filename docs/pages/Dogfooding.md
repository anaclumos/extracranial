> Eating dog food or "dogfooding" is using one's products or services. This can be a way for an organization to test its products in real-world usage using product management techniques. Hence, dogfooding can act as quality control and, eventually, testimonial advertising. Once in the market, dogfooding can demonstrate developers' confidence in their own products.
