[Project Heimdall](./../.././docs/pages/Project%20Heimdall.md)'s predecessor [hn.cho.sh](./../.././docs/pages/hn.cho.sh.md) operated on DeepL's 29 languages. On [Project Linguine](./../.././docs/pages/Project%20Linguine.md), I decided to migrate to the [Lingine Recipe](./../.././docs/pages/Project%20Linguine.md). How will we transfer the settings?
