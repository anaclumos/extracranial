Recently, the creator of juchamatjib.com and hellynee.com built both websites within 48 hours using the following tech stack, with speed being the primary criterion for selecting the technologies:

1. [Next.js](./../.././docs/pages/Next.js.md). Used for both [front-end](./../.././docs/pages/Front-end.md) and server-side development.
2. [tRPC](./../.././docs/pages/tRPC.md). Simplifies server-client communication without needing REST or [GraphQL](./../.././docs/pages/GraphQL.md).
3. [Tailwind](./../.././docs/pages/Tailwind.md) [CSS](./../.././docs/pages/CSS.md). Reduces time spent on styling decisions while maintaining design quality.
4. [Supabase](./../.././docs/pages/Supabase.md). Offers an easy-to-use [database](./../.././docs/pages/Database.md) with PostgreSQL and type-injected clients.
5. [AWS](./../.././docs/pages/AWS.md) Copilot: Provides hosting for the [Next.js](./../.././docs/pages/Next.js.md) projects on ECS.
6. tsconfig.json `strict: false` option: Allows faster development by fixing errors as they occur rather than prioritizing type safety.

These tools allowed the developer to create the websites quickly and efficiently.
