## [ChatGPT broke the EU plan to regulate AI](https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-plan-regulate-chatgpt-openai-artificial-intelligence-act/)

The [EU](./../.././docs/pages/EU.md) is grappling with how to regulate general-purpose [AI](./../.././docs/pages/AI.md), such as [OpenAI](./../.././docs/pages/OpenAI.md)'s [ChatGPT](./../.././docs/pages/ChatGPT.md), which can generate human-like text with no single intended use. The technology has upended work done on the [EU](./../.././docs/pages/EU.md)'s draft [AI](./../.././docs/pages/AI.md) regulation, the [Artificial Intelligence](./../.././docs/pages/AI.md) Act, which would designate some specific uses of [AI](./../.././docs/pages/AI.md) as "high-risk," binding developers to stricter requirements of transparency, safety, and human oversight. The rise of [ChatGPT](./../.././docs/pages/ChatGPT.md) is forcing [EU](./../.././docs/pages/EU.md) institutions to rewrite their draft plans, and lead lawmakers on the [AI](./../.././docs/pages/AI.md) Act are proposing stricter requirements on both developers and users of [ChatGPT](./../.././docs/pages/ChatGPT.md) and similar [AI](./../.././docs/pages/AI.md) models. Three-way negotiations between the European Commission, Council of the [EU](./../.././docs/pages/EU.md), and Parliament are expected to start in April at the earliest to hash out the details of a final [AI](./../.././docs/pages/AI.md) Act, with big tech firms watching closely.
