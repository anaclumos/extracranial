- [Contentlayer](https://www.contentlayer.dev/)
- The Content layer SDK tool helps you process your content data (such as [Markdown](./../.././docs/pages/Markdown.md) files or [CMS](./../.././docs/pages/CMS.md)) into type-safe [JSON](./../.././docs/pages/JSON.md) data that you can easily import into your application's pages. It also validates your content, generates type definitions, and outputs data objects ready to be imported as an ESM module.
