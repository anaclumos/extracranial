## Extension Ideas for [Obsidian](./../.././docs/pages/Obsidian.md)

- Exclude URLs in Unlinked Mentions
  - See [Obsidian Forum 7092](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/exclude-backlink-mentions-in-link-markup-from-suggested-backlinks/7092).
- Encapsulate File to Folder `Topic.md` â†’ `Topic/Topic.md`
- Review Page for Daily Notes
  - List view for Daily Notes like [Roam Research](./../.././docs/pages/Roam%20Research.md) and [Logseq](./../.././docs/pages/Logseq.md).
- Auto Delete Empty Files
- Lint Supports
- MDX Supports
- Prettier for Code Blocks
- Anonymized Images
  - Not `Pasted Image YYYY`
  - Not `Original Name Whatsoever`
- Auto Plural-Singular Linker

### Done

- Functional Templating (Done on [2022-10-17](./../.././docs/journals/2022-10-17.md))
  - Run functions like `getRandomhex()` when creating new posts or pasting attachments

### Discarded

- Aliases Link Consistency with Standard links
  - `Personal Knowledge Management` and `[PKM](./../.././docs/pages/PKM.md)` should act the same.
  - Not in some weird format like `PKM|Personal Knowledge Management.`
  - At least convert one to another.
