Prisma is an open-source [database](./../.././docs/pages/Database.md) toolkit developed to make it easier to work with databases in modern applications.

1. Prisma Client: An auto-generated and type-safe query builder for Node.js & [TypeScript](./../.././docs/pages/TypeScript.md).
2. Prisma Migrate: A declarative data modeling & migration system.
3. Prisma Studio: A modern [database](./../.././docs/pages/Database.md) IDE where you can view and edit data in your [database](./../.././docs/pages/Database.md).
4. [Prisma Accelerate](./../.././docs/pages/Prisma%20Accelerate.md)

ORM stands for Object-Relational Mapping. This programming technique allows developers to manage a [database](./../.././docs/pages/Database.md) like [JavaScript](./../.././docs/pages/JavaScript.md) objects, making interacting with the [database](./../.././docs/pages/Database.md) easier.
