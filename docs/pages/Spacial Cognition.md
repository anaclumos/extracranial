- A spacial understanding of hierarchy
- Very important for [Metaverse](./../.././docs/pages/Metaverse.md)
- Key reason of [Infinite Canvas](./../.././docs/pages/Infinite%20Canvas.md). Gives spacial understanding & relevancy
- [Three Column Design](./../.././docs/pages/Three%20Column%20Design.md) and [Sliding Panes](./../.././docs/pages/Sliding%20Panes.md) are a few ways of giving spacial cognition.
- Dozens of [Tools for Thought](./../.././docs/pages/Tools%20for%20Thought.md) use it. For example, [Heptabase](./../.././docs/pages/Heptabase.md).
