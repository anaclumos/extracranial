On February 2021, [Olaf Wolkenhauer (@olafwolkenhauer)](https://twitter.com/OlafWolkenhauer) [wrote](https://agenda.community/t/zettelkasten-roam-obsidian-remnote-notion-and-cong-does-not-work-as-expected/71102):

> SÃ¶nke Ahrens published 2017 the book _How to take intelligent notes_, which picked up on the [Zettelkasten](./../.././docs/pages/Atomic%20Notes.md) idea and discussed its value in boosting writing, learning, and thinking. In a 2020 YouTube video [how to take smart notes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPOI4f7yCag), he describes the history and ideas behind the [Zettelkasten](./../.././docs/pages/Atomic%20Notes.md) technique. **[Andy Matuschak](./../.././docs/pages/Andy%20Matuschak.md) advanced ideas in Ahrens' book by introducing the concept of "[Evergreen notes](./../.././docs/pages/Evergreen%20notes.md)"**. Instead of just having a blog post on the topic, Matuschak presented his concept with a webpage that implements and supports the [Zettelkasten](./../.././docs/pages/Atomic%20Notes.md) technique, using a web-based environment: [notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes)
