The Cauchy [distribution](./../.././docs/pages/Distribution.md) is a continuous [probability](./../.././docs/pages/Probability.md) [distribution](./../.././docs/pages/Distribution.md) named after the French mathematician Augustin Cauchy. It is also known as the Lorentzian [distribution](./../.././docs/pages/Distribution.md). It is characterized by its "thick-tailed" shape, meaning that it has a more significant proportion of data points in the tails of the [distribution](./../.././docs/pages/Distribution.md) than other common distributions like the normal [distribution](./../.././docs/pages/Distribution.md).

The Cauchy [distribution](./../.././docs/pages/Distribution.md) has a [PDF](./../.././docs/pages/PDF.md) ([probability](./../.././docs/pages/Probability.md) density function) given by:

$$
f(x) = \frac{1}{\pi}\cdot \frac{d}{d^2 + (x - m)^2} = \frac{1}{\pi d (1 + (\frac{x-m}{d})^2)}
$$

where $m$ is the location parameter and $d$ is the scale parameter. The Cauchy [distribution](./../.././docs/pages/Distribution.md) has no mean or [variance](./../.././docs/pages/Variance.md), as the [moments](./../.././docs/pages/Moments.md) do not exist for this [distribution](./../.././docs/pages/Distribution.md). The Cauchy [distribution](./../.././docs/pages/Distribution.md) is used in various fields, such as physics, [finance](./../.././docs/pages/Finance.md), and [statistics](./../.././docs/pages/Statistics.md), as it is often used to model phenomena with "thick-tailed" behavior or outliers. It is also used as a test case for various statistical methods, as its heavy tails make it more challenging to estimate statistical parameters accurately.
