> Svelte is a free and open-source [front-end](./../.././docs/pages/Front-end.md) compiler created by Rich Harris and maintained by the Svelte core team members. Svelte is not a monolithic JavaScript library imported by applications: instead, Svelte compiles [HTML](./../.././docs/pages/HTML.md) templates to specialized code that manipulates the [DOM](./../.././docs/pages/DOM.md) directly, which may reduce the size of transferred files and give better client performance; application code is also processed by the compiler, inserting calls to automatically recompute data and re-render [UI](./../.././docs/pages/UIUX.md) elements when the data they depend on is modified. This also avoids the overhead associated with intermediate runtime representations, such as virtual [DOM](./../.././docs/pages/DOM.md), unlike traditional frameworks (such as [React](./../.././docs/pages/React.md) and Vue), which carry out the bulk of their work at runtime, i.e., in the [browser](./../.././docs/pages/Web%20Browser.md). The compiler itself is written in [TypeScript](./../.././docs/pages/TypeScript.md). Its source code is licensed under MIT License and hosted on [GitHub](./../.././docs/pages/GitHub.md).
