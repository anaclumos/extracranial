The search never ended to find the perfect [ebook](./../.././docs/pages/eBook.md). Refer to this [HN](./../.././docs/pages/Hacker%20News.md) thread

> I just saw the [Kindle](./../.././docs/pages/Kindle.md) Scribe launch, but it still does not satisfy my needed features, albeit being my near-perfect version of [Kindle](./../.././docs/pages/Kindle.md). First and foremost, I would want to have a good e-reader with multiple e-book store vendors (no lock-ins), with additional features like the following:
>
> ### My _good-to-haves_
>
> - USB-C
> - Decently large screen
> - Pen support
> - Decently long-lasting battery (more than 20 hours of reading time is enough for me)
> - Decent Note-taking & highlighting features
> - Decent software (Onyx fails here)
> - Pretty easy way to send & open files on the device (for PDFs, PPTXs, [EPUB](./../.././docs/pages/EPUB.md)s)
>
> Recent [Kindle](./../.././docs/pages/Kindle.md) versions check almost all checkboxes here, but I would love to see multiple e-book vendors. I also read many Korean books, and the [Kindle](./../.././docs/pages/Kindle.md) store lacks Korean titles. Knowing that Amazon loses money for each [Kindle](./../.././docs/pages/Kindle.md) sale to boost their [Kindle](./../.././docs/pages/Kindle.md) store revenue, it seems unlikely that [Kindle](./../.././docs/pages/Kindle.md) will open up external app support.

While the search to find the best [ebook](./../.././docs/pages/eBook.md) reader is yet to finish, a recent discovery on [2023-01-12](./../.././docs/journals/2023-01-12.md) suggested that if the digital tool [vanish](./../.././docs/pages/Tools%20Must%20Vanish.md)es, digital tools no longer matter â€” essentially solving the [Digital Addiction](./../.././docs/pages/Digital%20Addiction.md).

Furthermore, I fell in love with [Book Scanning](./../.././docs/pages/Book%20Scanning.md) as a [PDF](./../.././docs/pages/PDF.md) with [OCR](./../.././docs/pages/OCR.md), and I figured it is very lovable. I can't understand why [Ridi](./../.././docs/pages/Ridi.md) and [Kindle](./../.././docs/pages/Kindle.md) make the purchased book un-exportable.
