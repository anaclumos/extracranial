iOS stands for "iPhone Operating System." It's the operating system software that runs on [Apple](./../.././docs/pages/Apple.md)'s iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch, and Apple TV devices. iOS controls how the device functions and provides a platform for other apps to run on. It's similar to the software that runs on a computer and can be thought of as the "brain" of the device. iOS was unveiled in 2007 as the first-generation iPhone. It's the world's second-most widely installed mobile operating system after [Android](./../.././docs/pages/Android.md). iOS is based on the Macintosh [OS X](./../.././docs/pages/macOS.md) and supports Objective-C, C, [C++](./../.././docs/pages/C%2B%2B.md), and [Swift](./../.././docs/pages/Swift.md) programming languages. Major versions of iOS are released annually. The current stable version, iOS 16, was released to the public on September 12, 2022.
