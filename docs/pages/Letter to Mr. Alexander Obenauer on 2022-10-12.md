- [Letter](./../.././docs/pages/Mail.md) to Mr. [Alexander Obenauer](./../.././docs/pages/Alexander%20Obenauer.md) on [2022-10-12](./../.././docs/journals/2022-10-12.md)

Dear Mr. Obenauer,

I am Sunghyun Cho. I am a current CS university student at [USC](./../.././docs/pages/University%20of%20Southern%20California.md).
I want to become a computer scientist in the future, just like you!

I just wanted to say that your website is 🔥.
I love how you created "Zettlekasten" Lab Notes!
I am also profoundly interested in Computing and how information gets represented on the web.
My notes are on [https://cho.sh](https://cho.sh/). Please take a look!

I'll take a deeper look into your website after my midterm tomorrow 😭.

Hope we can keep in touch!

Best regards,
Sunghyun

Dear Mr. Obenauer,

I do not currently have a [newsletter](./../.././docs/pages/Newsletter.md). I was looking for a developer-friendly mailing platform ([Substack](./../.././docs/pages/Substack.md) knocks off here).
I tried using Mailgun before and didn't like it, but I don't want to bother dealing with [AWS](./../.././docs/pages/AWS.md) SES.
I've heard good things about Revue, although I haven't tried it.
Is there any good platform you would recommend?

Best Regards,  
Sunghyun Cho
