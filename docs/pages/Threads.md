Not to be confused with [Threads (Service)](./../.././docs/pages/Threads%20%28Service%29.md)

In [computer science](./../.././docs/pages/Computer%20Science.md), a thread is a minor sequence of programmed instructions that can be managed independently by a [scheduler](./../.././docs/pages/Scheduler.md), typically a part of the operating system. Threads are a way for a program to divide (concurrent) itself into two or more simultaneously (or pseudo-simultaneously) running tasks.
