[LavaLab](./../.././docs/pages/LavaLab.md) Cohort of Spring 2023.

## Trends

### More Info-focused Startups

With the recent advent of [GPT](./../.././docs/pages/Generative%20Pre-trained%20Transformer.md) APIs, people can now [generate intelligence](./../.././docs/pages/Generative%20Intelligence.md) on the fly, tailored for insights.

- Brief aims to solve info overload for news readers
- Documate aims to solve info overload for PDF-manual based industry, most notably the hardware industry
- Codeflow gives visual information about your codebase.
- Hive gives [One and only](./../.././docs/pages/One%20and%20only.md) search interface to fish your query.
- Firefly captures lost information of [Broken Feedback Loop](./../.././docs/pages/Broken%20Feedback%20Loop.md).
- All tools use some [GPT](./../.././docs/pages/Generative%20Pre-trained%20Transformer.md) or Semantic Analysis.

### No More Crypto & [Web3](./../.././docs/pages/Web3.md) Startups

This was expected.

### More [DX](./../.././docs/pages/DX.md) Startups.

LavaLab mostly revolved around consumer products. This time around, there are more DX-focused startups.

### Jump into the sudden void of power

After [Zenly](./../.././docs/pages/Zenly.md) shut down, many players target that power void. It will be the most guaranteed way to success, with one catch -- it's a winner-takes-all market.

### [Interactive Instructions](./../.././docs/pages/Interactive%20Articles.md)

I loved how Hive demoed their app. To demonstrate their semantic search, they made a cross puzzle to make me try out the search functions.

## Case Studies

### Firefly

It is a user review collector, but it also collects console results, cookies, and stack traces, making it super easy to collect user feedback with technical details -- like [Channel.io](./../.././docs/pages/Channel.io.md) level easy.

### Brief

News recommending app, just like [Artifact](./../.././docs/pages/Artifact.md), but it shows a one-liner explanation, so you don't need to dive into the article. A similar approach to [Project Heimdall](./../.././docs/pages/Project%20Heimdall.md), by attempting [Algorithmic Recommendation Engine for Texts](./../.././docs/pages/Algorithmic%20Recommendation%20Engine%20for%20Texts.md).

### Documate

Documentations tool that generates a [Docusaurus](./../.././docs/pages/Docusaurus.md)-like website, given a PDF. Integrated [GPT](./../.././docs/pages/Generative%20Pre-trained%20Transformer.md) for semantic searches and Chat explanation: [Conversational AI Tools for Thought](./../.././docs/pages/Conversational%20AI%20Tools%20for%20Thought.md).

### Codeflow

Visualizes the dependencies of internal code and function calls. Similar to [IntelliJ](./../.././docs/pages/IntelliJ.md) Flow.

### Hive

[Search-based Tools for Thought](./../.././docs/pages/Search-based%20Tools%20for%20Thought.md) for Teams. Given you connect your Google Workspace, Slack, Figma, etc., it will work as a super search.

### Beacon

Similar to [Bondee](./../.././docs/pages/Bondee.md) and [Zenly](./../.././docs/pages/Zenly.md).
But it aims more toward nudging people to meet each other more.
[Nudge](./../.././docs/pages/Nudge.md)?

### Clarity

A digital library for your cosmetics & skincare product.
