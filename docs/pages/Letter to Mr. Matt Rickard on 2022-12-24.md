Dear Mr. [Rickard](./../.././docs/pages/Matt%20Rickard.md),

I'm on my way back to my home from [Seoul](./../.././docs/pages/%EC%84%9C%EC%9A%B8.md) to Daejeon in [Korea](./../.././docs/pages/%EB%8C%80%ED%95%9C%EB%AF%BC%EA%B5%AD.md), and I just got this post -- I love this post!

There are countless cases where [Twitter](./../.././docs/pages/Twitter.md) troubled up, but the above point is the most prominent one. [Musk](./../.././docs/pages/Elon%20Musk.md) does seem to desire "free money," as you pointed out, based on his track record for a couple of weeks. But before that, he hinted at his desire for a [Super App](./../.././docs/pages/Super%20App.md). What concerns me more is the "[Super App](./../.././docs/pages/Super%20App.md)" that [Musk](./../.././docs/pages/Elon%20Musk.md) wanted to build.

You mentioned a couple of times about a potential [Super App](./../.././docs/pages/Super%20App.md) in the [US](./../.././docs/pages/United%20States%20of%20America.md), but this may be a very alarming scenario for the people in the [United States](./../.././docs/pages/United%20States%20of%20America.md).

From my native [Korean](./../.././docs/pages/%ED%95%9C%EB%AF%BC%EC%A1%B1.md) experience, the [Super App](./../.././docs/pages/Super%20App.md) is mighty and dangerous. We have a [Super App](./../.././docs/pages/Super%20App.md) called [Kakao](./../.././docs/pages/Kakao.md), a go-to for everything. It's [Google](./../.././docs/pages/Google.md) + [Facebook](./../.././docs/pages/Facebook.md) + Uber + Uber Eats + Netflix + Spotify + AirBnB. [Kakao](./../.././docs/pages/Kakao.md) had an outage last October for about a week, and... It wasn't good. All of the economies stopped.

I know [Musk](./../.././docs/pages/Elon%20Musk.md) is a very inconsistent person. He could take one day order to build a [Super App](./../.././docs/pages/Super%20App.md) platform. And that could change silicon valley once and for all.

As Jobs said, [Musk](./../.././docs/pages/Elon%20Musk.md) can "put a dent" in the universe. Would that be the rise of the blue bird into a mighty Phoenix? Or would this be the last flapping of the once-powerful hawk?

I don't know -- perhaps [Musk](./../.././docs/pages/Elon%20Musk.md) fired too much to rewrite stuff!

P.S. I hope my [emails](./../.././docs/pages/Mail.md) are okay with you! I love thought-invoking posts, and I pay massive attention to the Silicon Valley stories -- I have been, and still to this day, loving your posts!

Best regards,

Sunghyun
