Scala is a general-purpose, high-level, multi-paradigm programming language. It's a statically typed language that includes features of functional programming and object-oriented programming. Scala stands for "Scalable Language". Its source code is compiled into bytecode and executed by the [Java virtual machine](./../.././docs/pages/JVM.md) ([JVM](./../.././docs/pages/JVM.md)).

Scala is designed to be concise and to express common programming patterns in a type-safe way. It's often used to build web applications and services, write [back-end](./../.././docs/pages/Back-end.md) code for mobile apps, or create big data systems.

Scala is almost ten times faster than [Python](./../.././docs/pages/Python.md) because it relies on the [JVM](./../.././docs/pages/JVM.md) during runtime. Generally, compiled languages perform faster than interpreted languages.
