> In internationalization, CJK character is a collective term for the Chinese, Japanese, and Korean languages, which include Chinese characters and derivatives in their writing systems, sometimes paired with other scripts. The CJK characters often have Hànzì in Chinese, Kanji, and Kana in Japanese and Hanja and Hangul in Korean. Vietnamese can be included, making the abbreviation CJKV, as Vietnamese historically used Chinese characters which they were known as Chữ Hán and Chữ Nôm in Vietnamese (Hán-Nôm altogether).
