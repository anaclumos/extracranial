- [Computer Systems](./../.././docs/pages/Computer%20Systems.md)
- Processor speed increased by 55% every year.
  - $\log(2) \over \log(1.55)$ gives $1.58$, aligning with the Moore's Law.
- Memory speed increased by 7% every year.
- Latency gets higher and higher between the processor and memory
- Solution with [Latency and Throughput](./../.././docs/pages/Latency%20and%20Throughput.md)
  - Improve Latency
    - Improve the speed of memory itself (hard!)
    - Put memory closer to the processor or _within_ the processor.
  - Improve [Throughput](./../.././docs/pages/Throughput.md)
    - Organize more efficiently
    - Hierarchy of Memories
    - [Principles of Locality](./../.././docs/pages/Principles%20of%20Locality.md)
