Essay on [2023-07-25](./../.././docs/journals/2023-07-25.md).

I've been thinking for a while about getting a [Dumb Phone](./../.././docs/pages/Dumb%20Phone.md) in the context of [Dopamine Detox](./../.././docs/pages/Dopamine%20Detox.md). While most of the dumb phones are great, the problem was that I couldn't switch devices back and forth easily. Plus, sometimes, I would need help from modern apps, which rendered it impossible on these devices.

Then, I had an epiphany. Apple Watch is the prime dumb phone! It does all the things I wanted to do -- not being able to scroll infinite media, not watching YouTube (technically, you can watch YouTube on watches, but if you do, you seriously have a problem :p), not wasting time browsing meaningless websites... It also gives me benefits like Apple Pay and navigation. This was perfect!
