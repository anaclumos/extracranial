In [Probability](./../.././docs/pages/Probability.md),

$A$ and $B$ are independent when

$$
P(B|A) = P(B)
$$

Whether $A$ happens or not does not affect the probability of $B$.

By definition of $P(B|A)$,

$$
{P(A \cap B)} = P(A)P(B)
$$

In this case, ${P(A \cap B)}$ is the **joint** and $P(A)P(B)$ is the **marginal distributions**.

If $A$ is independent of $B$, $B$ is also independent of $A$.

Furthermore, if $A$ and $B$ are independent, the following three are also independent.

1. $A \& B^C$
1. $A^C \& B$
1. $A^C \& B^C$
