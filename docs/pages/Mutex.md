> In computer science, a lock or mutex (from mutual exclusion) is a synchronization primitive: a mechanism that enforces limits on access to a resource when there are many threads of execution. A lock is designed to implement a mutual exclusion concurrency control policy, and with various possible methods, multiple unique implementations exist for different applications. [Lock (computer science)](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock_(computer_science)>)

```cpp
m.lock();

// some critical operation
// uninterrupted

m.unlock();
```
