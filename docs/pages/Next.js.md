> Next.js is an open-source web development framework created by [Vercel](./../.././docs/pages/Vercel.md) enabling [React](./../.././docs/pages/React.md)-based web applications with server-side rendering and generating static websites. [React](./../.././docs/pages/React.md) documentation mentions Next.js among "Recommended Toolchains," advising it to developers as a solution when "Building a server-rendered website with Node.js". Where traditional [React](./../.././docs/pages/React.md) apps can only render their content in the client-side [browser](./../.././docs/pages/Web%20Browser.md), Next.js extends this functionality to include applications rendered on the server side. The copyright and trademarks for Next.js are owned by [Vercel](./../.././docs/pages/Vercel.md), which also maintains and leads its open-source development.
