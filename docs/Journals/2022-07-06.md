## Personal Notes
- [PARA](../Interests/PARA.md)... might be worse than I thought?
	- The structure is unintuitive and redundant.
	- I might come up with my own structure.
	- Current idea: `Projects`, `Interests`, `Readings`, `Journals`.
- Merged! ![](../Assets/835DEBDD-38B5-40E8-9C3F-4FA432515537.jpeg)
- A successful business sells lifestyles and dreams. Did they succeed by selling a dream, or did they rebrand themselves when they got enough cash?

## Work Notes

### [Brane](../Projects/Brane.md)

- Decided with `two-roots.` Locally confirmed it operates correctly.

- One thing to confirm: `two-roots` uses `getBoundingClientRectAsync`

The above redundancy is for different browser supports for `module`. [Reference](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45943494/what-s-the-purpose-of-the-html-nomodule-attribute-for-script-elements-if-the-d)

### [Brane](../Projects/Brane.md) WorkerDOM Non-blocking Example

![](../Assets/Pasted%20image%2020220706013827.png)

- Implemented the Technical Proof of Concept and posted here: _PoC that two WorkerDOM upgraded threads don't block each other_ - [Two Roots](https://brane.vercel.app/two-roots-with-infinite-loop/)
1.  Open Dev Console.
2.  Press Health Check in both Root 1 and Root 2.
3.  Check that both are alive.
4.  After pressing "while(true)" in Root 1, only Root 2 will respond.
