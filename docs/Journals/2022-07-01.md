## [Building a Second Brain](../Readings/Building%20a%20Second%20Brain.md)

- In the middle of reading this book, I realized that the term _[Digital Brain](../Notes/Digital%20Brain.md)_, _Second Brain_, _Digital Garden_, and [PKM](../Notes/PKM.md) are used interchangeably, they are not quite the same.
- I have organized them in the following manner.

| Term                     | Meaning                                          |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Second Brain             | Implementation for _augmenting_ your thoughts.   |
| Digital Garden           | Implementation for _documenting_ your knowledge. |
| [PKM](../Notes/PKM.md)   | Architecture for Digital Garden.                 |
| [PARA](../Notes/PARA.md) | Architecture for Second Brain.                   |

- Digital Brain is a digitally implemented Second Brain.

| Second Brain                                                            | Digital Garden                                                                                           |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Project-oriented                                                        | Knowledge-oriented                                                                                       |
| Notes are in Britannica Style                                           | Notes are in Wikipedia Style                                                                             |
| Allows foldering                                                        | Prohibits foldering                                                                                      |
| Allows archiving                                                        | Prohibits archiving                                                                                      |
| Focuses on managing different projects that grow into a creative garage | Focuses on creating and tending [Evergreen](../Notes/Evergreen.md) posts that grow into a knowledge base |

I like the CODE Procedure in PARA architecture as a project management system, which does more than [PKM](../Notes/PKM.md). To be exact, [PKM](../Notes/PKM.md) only takes care of the _Resource_ section in [PARA](../Notes/PARA.md).

## Interesting Webs

### [How we think about browsers | The GitHub Blog](https://github.blog/2022-06-10-how-we-think-about-browsers/)

- GitHub plans to switch to ES2020 with optional chaining and nullish coalescing.
- This will reduce 10kb in JavaScript.
- Most GitHub users use fairly up-to-date browsers.
