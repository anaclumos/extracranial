- If I generate a random 6-digit hex as an ID, how likely is a hash collision?
	- Side note, even if a hash collision occurs, all records remain in the git history, so we don't need any collision checks.
- Nonetheless, it seems very unlikely.
- Let's try mathematical and computational approaches to verify this.
