### Designing an App's feel

- Motion design brings an app to life by guiding users and providing them with feedback.
- Add easing to your animations to help add a responsive and natural feel.
- Quick, light, and snappy animations are less distracting and intrusive for users.
- Use springs to respond to user interaction and provide realistic feedback
- Guide users through an animation by thoughtfully timing out the motion.
- Be purposeful with animations. Only include motion to support the user's experience. Unnecessary motion distracts users.
