## [Building a Second Brain](./../.././docs/pages/Building%20a%20Second%20Brain.md)

- In the middle of reading this book, I realized that the term _Digital Brain_, _Second Brain_, _Digital Garden_, and [PKM](./../.././docs/pages/PKM.md) are used interchangeably, they are not quite the same.
- I have organized them in the following manner.

| Term           | Meaning                                          |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Second Brain   | Implementation for _augmenting_ your thoughts.   |
| Digital Garden | Implementation for _documenting_ your knowledge. |
| [PKM](./../.././docs/pages/PKM.md)        | Architecture for Digital Garden.                 |
| [PARA](./../.././docs/pages/PARA.md)       | Architecture for Second Brain.                   |

- Digital Brain is a digitally implemented Second Brain.

| Second Brain                                                            | Digital Garden                                                                            |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Project-oriented                                                        | Knowledge-oriented                                                                        |
| Notes are in Britannica Style                                           | Notes are in [Wikipedia](./../.././docs/pages/Wikipedia.md) Style                                                          |
| Allows foldering                                                        | Prohibits foldering                                                                       |
| Allows archiving                                                        | Prohibits archiving                                                                       |
| Focuses on managing different projects that grow into a creative garage | Focuses on creating and tending [Evergreen notes](./../.././docs/pages/Evergreen%20notes.md) posts that grow into a knowledge base |

I like the [CODE Procedure](./../.././docs/pages/CODE%20Procedure.md) in [PARA](./../.././docs/pages/PARA.md) architecture as a [project](./../.././docs/pages/Project.md) management system, which does more than [PKM](./../.././docs/pages/PKM.md). To be exact, [PKM](./../.././docs/pages/PKM.md) only takes care of the _Resource_ section in [PARA](./../.././docs/pages/PARA.md).

## Interesting Webs

### [How we think about browsers | The GitHub Blog](https://github.blog/2022-06-10-how-we-think-about-browsers/)

- GitHub plans to switch to ES2020 with optional chaining and nullish coalescing.
- This will reduce 10kb in [JavaScript](./../.././docs/pages/JavaScript.md).
- Most GitHub users use fairly up-to-date [browsers](./../.././docs/pages/Web%20Browser.md).
