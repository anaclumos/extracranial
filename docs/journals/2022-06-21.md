## Today's [Pragmatic Engineer](../notes/pragmatic-engineer.md)

Twitter implemented a much more strict agile model with Sprint work models.
Engineers and managers do not welcome this change.

Coinbase laid off ~18% of its workforce.
Slightly earlier, employees started petitioning to remove the leadership positions.
In general, the crypto market stagnated, facing a potential winter.
This roots in a watershed moment from the colossal downfall of Terra.

Layoffs in big techs accelerated.
Luckily these layoffs remain predictable: most are cash-burning companies that rely on VC money to sustain the business.
Meanwhile, companies started posting profitability reports with job postings.

[Contra Wirecutter on the IKEA air purifier](https://dynomight.net/ikea-purifier/)
- Air filters do not work like sieves. They are complicated materials that create a maze of tangled paths for air to run through.
- So it’s rubbish to claim that an H13 filter will do a better job than an E12 filter for very fine particles. Those are easy to catch because they are well into the diffusion regime, so both an E12 and an H13 filter will block almost all of them.

[I fucking hate Jira.](https://ifuckinghatejira.com/21/)
- *All of it. It encourages micro-management. It encourages more and more process.*
- *Any problem gets solved with “more JIRA,” which stops working when too much JIRA causes the remaining problems.*

[writing one sentence per line | Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/1s)
- *My advice to anyone who writes: Try writing one sentence per line. I’ve been doing it for twenty years, improving my writing more than anything else.*
- Helps judge sentence by itself
- Helps varying sentence lengths
- Helps you organize content

Luckily I can use this right away since markdown supports strict line-breaking.

[Apple's Feedback Mechanism is Broken — Liss is More](https://www.caseyliss.com/2022/6/20/feedback-is-broken-stop-trying-to-make-radar-happen)
- *In the roughly 225 days since I filed that feedback, I received precisely zero… well… feedback*
- *`request.usesCPUOnly = true`. That's it.*
- *Instead, let me make it clear what developers want:*
	- [*Documentation that, um, exists; and when it exists, it shouldn’t suck*](https://www.caseyliss.com/2020/11/10/on-apples-pisspoor-documentation). 
	- *A way to have two-way feedback with engineering*

I also submitted 18 feedbacks since 2017-ish and only heard back once.
