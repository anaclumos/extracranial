## Personal Research

### [Facebook's TikTok-like redesign marks the sunset of the social networking era](https://www.axios.com/2022/07/25/sunset-social-network-facebook-tiktok)

- [Facebook](./../.././docs/pages/Facebook.md) used a social network model and rapidly grew on the back of smartphone development
- [Facebook](./../.././docs/pages/Facebook.md) is now reorganizing itself around algorithmic content, not **social** networks
- This is very similar to TikTok. Big social media are usually reorganizing in this way
- After the 2008 recession, Internet culture and [economy](./../.././docs/pages/Economy.md) were formed around [Facebook](./../.././docs/pages/Facebook.md) and [Twitter](./../.././docs/pages/Twitter.md)
- [Facebook](./../.././docs/pages/Facebook.md) acquires or overtakes MySpace, [Instagram](./../.././docs/pages/Instagram.md), and Snapchat, driving relationships into human business models
- But revenue increases with problems: computation of human relationships, increase of online noise, etc

### [A little trick to spam the spammers](https://misc.l3m.in/txt/spam.txt)

- Submit the spammer's [email](./../.././docs/pages/Mail.md)
- Make sure the spammers get at least one of their messages
- I now keep a list of [emails](./../.././docs/pages/Mail.md) from these spam sites and subscribe them all to the various [newsletters](./../.././docs/pages/Newsletter.md).
- lol
