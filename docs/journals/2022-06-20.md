[Cloudflare](./../.././docs/pages/Cloudflare.md): [Private Access Tokens: eliminating CAPTCHAs on iPhones and Macs with open standards](https://blog.cloudflare.com/eliminating-captchas-on-iphones-and-macs-using-new-standard/)

- A completely invisible, private way to validate that real users are visiting your site.
- This will eliminate nearly 100% of CAPTCHAs served to these users.
- Usability aside, mobile environments present an additional challenge in that they are increasingly API-driven. CAPTCHAs cannot work in an API environment where [JavaScript](./../.././docs/pages/JavaScript.md) can't be rendered or a WebView can't be called.

Note that this is not [Apple](./../.././docs/pages/Apple.md) Passkey. This is the Privacy Pass standard. [Apple](./../.././docs/pages/Apple.md) Passkey is a FIDO alliance.
