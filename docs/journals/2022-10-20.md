### [EasyList is in trouble, and so are many ad blockers](https://adguard.com/en/blog/easylist-filter-problem-help.html)

1.  There's an [open-source Android browser](https://github.com/hazuki0x0/YuzuBrowser) (now seemingly abandoned) that implements ad-blocking functionality.
2.  This [browser](./../.././docs/pages/Web%20Browser.md) is forked by a couple of other [browsers](./../.././docs/pages/Web%20Browser.md) that are very popular in India.
3.  The problem is that this [browser](./../.././docs/pages/Web%20Browser.md) has a severe flaw. It tries to download filter updates on **every startup**, and on [Android](./../.././docs/pages/Android.md), it may happen many times daily. It can even happen when the [browser](./../.././docs/pages/Web%20Browser.md) is running in the background.
