### [Announcing Sandpack 2.0 and a Node.js runtime for any browser](https://codesandbox.io/blog/announcing-sandpack-2)

- Nodebox--a fast [Node.js](./../.././docs/pages/Node.js.md) runtime that allows you to run server-side code in any [browser](./../.././docs/pages/Web%20Browser.md)
- you can bring your docs to a new level, as Nodebox allows running server-side examples. Go ahead and add [Next.js](./../.././docs/pages/Next.js.md) or any Vite-based examples and tutorials for Node scripts… all of these will run for everyone visiting your Docs, regardless of their browser or device. Please take a look at our [brand-new Sandpack Docs](https://sandpack.codesandbox.io/docs) for a glimpse of all the exciting things you can achieve with interactive documentation
- Nodebox is a high-level abstraction of [Node.js](./../.././docs/pages/Node.js.md). That means it doesn't implement some of the small details of [Node.js](./../.././docs/pages/Node.js.md), but we made various tweaks to make it compatible with every [browser](./../.././docs/pages/Web%20Browser.md). So, Nodebox aims for application compatibility, not [Node.js](./../.././docs/pages/Node.js.md) feature parity
  - Difference with WebContainers
- WebContainers is a technology that allows you to run [Node.js](./../.././docs/pages/Node.js.md) in the [browser](./../.././docs/pages/Web%20Browser.md). However, it uses modern [browser](./../.././docs/pages/Web%20Browser.md) technologies like [SharedArrayBuffer](./../.././docs/pages/SharedArrayBuffer.md), which makes it impossible to run in [Safari](./../.././docs/pages/Safari.md) and requires the user to set additional `Cross-Origin-Isolation` headers on the server to run any code
- Instead, we implemented Nodebox without modern [browser](./../.././docs/pages/Web%20Browser.md) technologies to make it run in any [browser](./../.././docs/pages/Web%20Browser.md) (like [iOS](./../.././docs/pages/iOS.md) and [Safari](./../.././docs/pages/Safari.md)) with minimal setup. The disadvantage is that Nodebox will use more memory when you spawn more [threads](./../.././docs/pages/Threads.md), and we cannot get full Node [API](./../.././docs/pages/API.md) compatibility (for example, we cannot use synchronous `fork`). This is okay for Nodebox because it was built to run small projects and models, which it does well. If you want to do full development in the [browser](./../.././docs/pages/Web%20Browser.md), we recommend using our micro VM technology instead

### [WebContainer API is here.](https://blog.stackblitz.com/posts/webcontainer-api-is-here/)

- In 2021 [we announced WebContainers](https://blog.stackblitz.com/posts/introducing-webcontainers/), a novel [WebAssembly](./../.././docs/pages/WebAssembly.md)-based operating system that enables [Node.js](./../.././docs/pages/Node.js.md) to run entirely inside the [browser](./../.././docs/pages/Web%20Browser.md). Over the last two years, millions of developers have used WebContainers each month as its powers, among others, the StackBlitz editor
- The more use cases we see, the more excited we are about the future that WebContainers unlock for the entire web ecosystem. Here are some of the fantastic things they've been building using the WebContainer [API](./../.././docs/pages/API.md) so far
  - Interactive coding tutorials
  - Production-grade web IDEs
  - [AI](./../.././docs/pages/AI.md) applications
  - No-code/Low-code environments
- Key Features of the [API](./../.././docs/pages/API.md)
  - In-[browser](./../.././docs/pages/Web%20Browser.md) Filesystem. WebContainers boot with an ephemeral virtual file system stored in memory. You can programmatically load in/out files and directories and perform standard file system operations on them.
  - Development server. Spin up [HTTP](./../.././docs/pages/HTTP.md) servers on-demand inside the WebContainer and receive a preview URL that can be shared with your users or displayed directly in your app with an `iframe`. The virtualized TCP network stack is mapped to the [browser](./../.././docs/pages/Web%20Browser.md)'s `ServiceWorker` [API](./../.././docs/pages/API.md). It runs entirely locally, so the server will continue to work even if your user loses the Internet connection.
  - [Node.js](./../.././docs/pages/Node.js.md) Command-Line. [Node.js](./../.././docs/pages/Node.js.md) commands can be passed directly into WebContainers for execution on page load or triggered by user behavior in your application. You can `npm install` packages, start new Node servers, or scaffold out applications, just like in a local dev environment.
