## Personal Notes

- [PARA](./../.././docs/pages/PARA.md)... might be worse than I thought?
  - The structure is unintuitive and redundant.
  - I might come up with my own structure.
  - Current idea: `Projects`, `Research`, `Readings`, `Journals`.
- contact mail and signup mail -- separation necessary?
- Merged! ![1ED417.jpeg](./../.././docs/assets/1ED417.jpeg)
- A successful business sells lifestyles and dreams. Did they succeed by selling a dream, or did they rebrand themselves when they got enough cash?

## Work Notes

### [Brane](./../.././docs/pages/Brane.md)

- Decided with `two-roots.` Locally confirmed it operates correctly.

- One thing to confirm: `two-roots` uses `getBoundingClientRectAsync`

![3AB4D2.png](./../.././docs/assets/3AB4D2.png)


</figure>

- Implemented the Technical [Proof of Concept](./../.././docs/pages/Proof%20of%20Concept.md) and posted here: _[PoC](./../.././docs/pages/Proof%20of%20Concept.md) that two [WorkerDOM](./../.././docs/pages/WorkerDOM.md) upgraded threads don't block each other_ - [Two Roots](https://brane.vercel.app/two-roots-with-infinite-loop/)

1.  Open Dev Console.
2.  Press Health Check in both Root 1 and Root 2.
3.  Check that both are alive.
4.  After pressing "while(true)" in Root 1, only Root 2 will respond.
