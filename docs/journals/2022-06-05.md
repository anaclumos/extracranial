- I am not a taxonomist. Categorizing content is not my thing. Blogging platforms, by default, expect you to apply some taxonomy to the bit of content you are writing. Is it a "page", "blog", "node", "custom node", or "custom post type"? It overlooks the option to tag it, and if you don't, that's fine. It asks you to assign it to a category; if you don't, that is not fine. It lands in "Uncategorized," displaying that you don't care deeply enough about your content. Absolute "blue shirt" ðŸ‘•. - [Foam as My Content Engine | RheinardKorf.com](https://rheinardkorf.com/foam-as-my-content-engine/)
- I need something straightforward to publish. I wouldn't say I like friction. I strongly dislike slow DB queries and slow web-based admin interfaces. I need to be able to drop my content into something like "Pandoc", "Marked", or "Rehype" and see a collection of interconnected thoughts. I should publish it with most static site generators without feeling lock-in. - [Foam as My Content Engine | RheinardKorf.com](https://rheinardkorf.com/foam-as-my-content-engine/)
