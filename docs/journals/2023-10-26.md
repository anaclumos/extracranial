Had a wow moment with [@RewindAI](https://twitter.com/RewindAI?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) today.

I had to write an email on lab meetings &amp; experiment results. Collecting and summarizing notes into an email would&#39;ve taken at least an hour, even with GPT.[@RewindAI](https://twitter.com/RewindAI?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) gave me a usable draft within 10 seconds.

Such a fantastic product.
