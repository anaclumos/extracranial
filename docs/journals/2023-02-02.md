### [defaultnamehere/verylegit.link: A URL shortener, but it makes the URLs look extremely dodgy instead](https://github.com/defaultnamehere/verylegit.link)

- A random sketchy URL path (the bit after the /) is generated when you give it a URL. The mapping between the real URL and the sketchy one is then saved. Since only the part after the / matters, you can use any domain you like.

### [Introducing Hermes, An Open Source Document Management System](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/introducing-hermes-an-open-source-document-management-system)

- To cope with the scaling challenges we built Hermes, a document management system designed to help HashiCorp employees author, review, approve, discover, and deprecate documents. Today, we are pleased to open source Hermes to the rest of the world
- Currently, Hermes supports [Google Workspace](https://workspace.google.com/). Once users login to Hermes, they can create document drafts using [Google](./../.././docs/pages/Google.md) Docs
- Hermes' Technology and Design
  - Hermes uses [Golang](https://go.dev/) for the [backend](./../.././docs/pages/Back-end.md) and [Ember.js](https://emberjs.com/) for the front end. It uses a [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) [database](./../.././docs/pages/Database.md) for storage and [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/) to power its search capabilities. It also leverages several [Google Workspace](https://workspace.google.com/) services for creating and modifying documents, sending [email](./../.././docs/pages/Mail.md), etc.
- Importantly, we are launching alongside [Helios](https://helios.hashicorp.design), HashiCorp's new open source product design system. Hermes uses Helios for its [UI](./../.././docs/pages/UI%20and%20UX.md) components, which allows it to match the look and feel of the HashiCorp product line, from internal tools to our commercial products like the HashiCorp Cloud Platform.
