## Personal Notes

- [Koreans](./../.././docs/pages/%ED%95%9C%EB%AF%BC%EC%A1%B1.md) have a _sharp question obsession_ -- they feel obsessed that they must give an elegant question that governs the entire landscape, and if not, they feel ashamed of giving questions (they think it reflects their intelligence, whereas it doesn't.)
- What is the notion of thinking in a [foreign language](./../.././docs/pages/Foreign%20Language.md)? What is the difference, and how do we bridge the gap between thinking in the [native language](./../.././docs/pages/Native%20Language.md)?
