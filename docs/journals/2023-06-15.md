In the end, [Back-end](./../.././docs/pages/Back-end.md) is just a way of modeling and packing the relations into relational mappings... For example, if I buy groceries from a store, `GroceryPurchasePlan` and `GroceryOffering`, and `GroceryPurchaseResult` are just separate mappings of the natural world entities.
