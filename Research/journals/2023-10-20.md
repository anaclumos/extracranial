- I strongly felt the need of loosely decoupled multiple services. One Apple service failed me today. Apple says, "to fix this, you'll need a new Apple ID" which is not viable for me. While there won't be any imminent changes (because it was such a minor service) it prompted me with an alerting realization that you can never have 'full' control inside Apple's ecosystem and especially for technophiles it can be extremely frustrating... So from now on this is a philosophy. Decouple everything, so that we can immediately replace whenever one fails. This shall escalate to a project soon.
