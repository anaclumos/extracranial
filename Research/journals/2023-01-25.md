## Preprocessors

Preprocessors are the directives to tell the compiler before turning them into codes.

`#include "file.h"` essentially copy-pastes that file to here. That is why we separate the codes into files. We don't want extra copies of a function.

`#ifdef _DEBUG` and `#endif` also exclude that block when compiling the production version.
