### [Kite is saying farewell](https://www.kite.com/blog/product/kite-is-saying-farewell/)

- From 2014 to 2021, Kite was a startup using [[AI]] to help developers write code. We have stopped working on Kite and are no longer supporting the Kite software
- First, we failed to deliver our vision of [[AI]]-assisted programming because we were 10+ years too early to market, i.e., the tech is not ready yet
- We failed to build a business because our product did not monetize, and it took too long to figure that out
- Then, we grew our user base. We executed very well here and expanded our user base to 500,000 monthly-active developers with almost zero marketing spend
- Then, our product failed to generate revenue. Our 500k developers would not pay to use it

### [Criticizing Computers](https://annasofia.xyz/2022/11/05/criticizing-computers.html)

- Good hardware is masking terrible software
- All the bad code is piling up, and we don't know how to get rid of it
- Programs used to be pipeable. Now, GUIs are killing pipes
- Computers are telling me what to do, but I can't tell them what to do
- Software is not technology. It is ideology
- Computers are fast, but in the dumbest way possible
- No one knows what they're doing, and it's a civilizational problem
