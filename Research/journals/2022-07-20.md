### [carbon-language/carbon-lang: Carbon language specification and documentation.](https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang)

A successor language for [[C++]] requires:

- Performance matching [[C++]]
- Bidirectional [[Interoperability]] with [[C++]]
- Gentle learning curve for [[C++]] Developers
- Comparable Expressivity and Support for Existing Design.
- Scalable migration for idiomatic [[C++]] code.

_With this approach, we can build on [[C++]]'s existing ecosystem and bring along existing investments, codebases, and developer populations._ Examples:

- [[JavaScript]] → [[TypeScript]]
- [[Java]] → Kotlin
- [[C++]] → _Carbon_
