## [It's still worth blogging in the age of AI :: Giles' blog](https://www.gilesthomas.com/2025/02/blogging-in-the-age-of-ai)

Now if the "solving other people's problems" aspect of blogging was purely altruistic, that wouldn't matter a jot. But of course it's not, there are a bunch of other reasons. Three that come to mind:

2. The sheer dopamine hit of knowing that other people like what you've done -- a higher-effort version of getting an upvote or like on social media.
3. Building a portfolio of writing you can point to.
