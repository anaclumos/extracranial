### [Speeding up the JavaScript ecosystem - one library at a time](https://marvinh.dev/blog/speeding-up-javascript-ecosystem/)

- At this point I stopped looking, but I'd assume that you'll find more of these minor performance issues in popular libraries. Today we mainly looked at some build tools, but [[UIUX|UI]] components or other libraries usually have the same low hanging performance issues
- Will this be enough to match Go's or [[Rust]]'s performance? Unlikely, but the thing is that the current [[JavaScript]] tools could be faster than they are today. And the things we looked at in this post are more or less just the tip of the iceberg

### [Scaling up a Mastodon server to 128K active users](https://gist.github.com/Gargron/aa9341a49dc91d5a721019d9e0c9fd11)

- What pgBouncer does is proxy connections to Postgres through a transaction pool, allowing you to support a vast number of client-side (in this case, client meaning [[Mastodon]]) connections with only a few actual [[database]] connections
- When you reach the point where it makes sense to move Postgres to its physical machine, I recommend maintaining pgBouncer on each device that wants to connect to it rather than putting pgBouncer on the same device as Postgres

### [[2211.05824] No Privacy in the Electronics Repair Industry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05824)

- First, through a field study with 18 service providers, we uncover that most service providers do not have any privacy policy or controls to safeguard device owners' personal data from snooping by technicians

### [Mastodon Isn't Just A Replacement For Twitter](https://www.noemamag.com/mastodon-isnt-just-a-replacement-for-twitter/)

- Subsidiarity is about achieving the right balance between local units and the larger systems
- The [[Fediverse]] is designed for subsidiarity. People cannot simply **[join Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/).** Instead, users join a particular server that runs [[Mastodon]] software, and that server can be moderated and operated in a wide variety of ways
- Rather than Twitter's one-size-fits-all public square, [[Mastodon]] is designed for smaller communities that interact with each other. One server might host hundreds of accounts or thousands, while another server might be for only a single user
- The [[fediverse]] allows users on each server to create their own codes of conduct and other rules. Social.coop, for instance, is a [[Mastodon]] server with a robust code of conduct meant to foster a healthy space for people most likely to experience marginalization elsewhere

### [Ruby adds a new core class called Data to represent simple immutable value objects](https://blog.saeloun.com/2022/11/22/data-immutable-object.html)

- Ruby 3.1 adds a [new core class called Data](https://github.com/ruby/ruby/pull/6353) to represent simple immutable value objects. The Data class helps define simple classes for value-alike objects that can be extended with custom methods.
