## Conditional Probability

In the real world, probabilities are not straightforward, like $P  \rightarrow Q$.
Therefore we translate into $P(B|A) \approx 1$. If $A$ happens, then B is most likely to happen. This defines as

$$
P(B|A) = {P(A \cap B) \over P(A)}
$$

This means

$$
{P(A \cap B)} = P(B|A) P(A)
$$

$P(B|A)$ is the **likelihood** and $P(A)$ is the **prior**.

## Independence

$A$ and $B$ are independent when

$$
P(B|A) = P(B)
$$

Whether $A$ happens or not does not affect the probability of $B$.

By definition of $P(B|A)$,

$$
{P(A \cap B)} = P(A)P(B)
$$

In this case, ${P(A \cap B)}$ is the **joint** and $P(A)P(B)$ is the **marginal distributions**.

If $A$ is independent of $B$, $B$ is also independent of $A$.

Furthermore, if $A$ and $B$ are independent, the following three are also independent.

1. $A & B^{C}$
1. $A^{C} & B$
1. $A^{C} & B^{C}$

## Multiplication Theorem

$$
{P(A \cap B)} = P(A)P(B|A)
$$

$$
{P(A \cap B \cap C)} = P(A)P(B|A)P(C|A \cup B)
$$

If $A$, $B$, and $C$ are all independent, it would be a simple multiplication of $P(A)P(B)P(C)$ and so on.

## Markovity

The future depends only on today, not the past.

$$
P(A_1 \cap A_2 \cap A_3 \cap \dots) = P(A_1) P(A_2 | A_1) P(A_3 | A_2) \dots
$$

## Partition Problem

$\{H_k\}$ partitions $\Omega$ if and only if

1. $U_k H_k = \Omega$
2. 1.$$
