### [defaultnamehere/verylegit.link: A URL shortener, but it makes the URLs look extremely dodgy instead](https://github.com/defaultnamehere/verylegit.link)

- When you give it a URL, a random sketchy URL path (the bit after the /) is generated. The mapping between the real URL and the sketchy one is then saved. Since only the part after the / matters, you can use any domain you like.

### [Introducing Hermes, An Open Source Document Management System](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/introducing-hermes-an-open-source-document-management-system)

- To cope with the scaling challenges we built Hermes, a document management system designed to help HashiCorp employees author, review, approve, discover, and deprecate documents. Today, we are pleased to open source Hermes to the rest of the world
- Currently, Hermes supports [Google Workspace](https://workspace.google.com/). Once users login to Hermes, they can create document drafts using Google Docs
- - [](#hermes-technology-and-design)Hermes’ Technology and Design
- Hermes uses [Golang](https://go.dev/) for the backend and [Ember.js](https://emberjs.com/) for the front end. It uses a [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database for storage and [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/) to power its search capabilities. It also leverages several [Google Workspace](https://workspace.google.com/) services for creating and modifying documents, sending email, etc.
- Importantly, we are launching alongside [Helios](https://helios.hashicorp.design), HashiCorp’s new open source product design system. Hermes uses Helios for its UI components, which allows it to match the look and feel of the HashiCorp product line, from internal tools to our commercial products like the HashiCorp Cloud Platform.
