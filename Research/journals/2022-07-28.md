### [Facebook's TikTok-like redesign marks the sunset of the social networking era](https://www.axios.com/2022/07/25/sunset-social-network-facebook-tiktok)

- Facebook is now reorganizing itself around algorithmic content, not "social" networks
- This is very similar to TikTok. Big social media are usually reorganizing in this way

- Facebook acquires or overtakes MySpace, Instagram, and Snapchat, driving relationships into human business models
- But revenue increases with problems: computation of human relationships, increase of online noise, etc
