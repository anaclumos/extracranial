## Work Research

Replaced Terser with ESBuild.
Improved build speed by 81%!
Knowing that Terser does slightly more optimization under the hood, we can imagine a build flow where we use ESBuild for developer build and Terser for Production builds.

Also, I succeeded on fooling `getBoundingClientRect()` on top of [[WorkerDOM]].
This happens synchronously using [[Atomics (JavaScript)]] and [[SharedArrayBuffer]].
For my internship's next and final step, I will containerize [[React]] Flip Toolkit on top of [[WorkerDOM]] using the same technique.

## Personal Research

### [[SMIME|S/MIME]] Certificates

Integrated Actalis [[SMIME|S/MIME]] certificate with iCloud Custom [[Mail|Email]] Domain.
Now shows a [[Checkmark|verified]] [[checkmark]].

### [[iiframe]]

Life drives you to places you never expected...
I never expected to get an internship at [[Karrot]] four months ago.
[[Brane]] is a vast [[project]] that a single intern can't finish.
However, I have some regrets about engineering and time management.
I did reach a milestone in implementing synchronicity inside [[WorkerDOM]], but now I finally realize various advanced use cases exist in such a framework.
One straightforward use case [[iiframe]] — improved iframe — that specializes in containerizing iframes in [[Web Worker|Web Workers]].
