### [US ban on at-home distilling is unconstitutional, Texas judge rules](https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/us-ban-at-home-distilling-is-unconstitutional-texas-judge-rules-2024-07-11/)

> A federal judge in Texas has ruled that a 156-year-old ban on at-home distilling is unconstitutional, siding with a group that advocates for legalizing the ability of people to produce spirits like whiskey and bourbon for their personal consumption.

> While prohibiting the possession of an at-home still meant to distill beverage alcohol might be convenient to protect tax revenue on spirits, it is not a sufficiently clear corollary to the positive power of laying and collecting taxes

### [The economics of a Postgres free tier](https://xata.io/blog/postgres-free-tier)

> We use shared clusters

> Our default Postgres cluster uses `db.t4g.medium` instances, which cost us around $70 per month at on-demand pricing (ignoring reserved instances for now for simplicity). Since we run 3 instances, the cost per month is $210 for the Postgres part. For OpenSearch, we use `r6gd.large.search` instance types, which cost about $140 per month. Again we have 3 nodes, so the cost for the OpenSearch part is $420/month. This means the "BoM" cost for one Postgres+OpenSearch cluster is around $630/month

> \= $0.315 per month

$0.315-$1.8, but more closer to the front
