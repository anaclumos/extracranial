- Companies building foundational models have partnered with cloud providers: [[OpenAI]] ([[Microsoft]]) and Anthropic ([[Google]]). These companies spend vast amounts on computing to train the models, but their biggest customer will also be their biggest vendor. Weird incentives abound
- Is chat even a promising paradigm for search?

- `String(describing:)` to `ObjectIdentifier`
- Stop converting unnecessary objects to `AnyHashable`.
- Auditing 3rd party framework initializers
- Accurately identifying performance bottlenecks and opportunities is often the most challenging part of any optimization. Notoriously, a common mistake is to measure A, optimize B, and conclude C
- That is where good performance tools help highlight bottlenecks and surface them. [[Xcode]] instruments, a part of [[Xcode]], come with several templates to help pinpoint various potential issues in a [[macOS]]/[[iOS]] application

### [Tech's Elite Hates Labor - Ed Zitron's Where's Your Ed At](https://ez.substack.com/p/techs-elite-hates-labor)

- Yes, the tech industry's loudest guys have all been demanding a **[great reset](https://unherd.com/thepost/david-sacks-the-tech-purge/),** where efficiency reigns, where the entitled are not invested in or are fired, or are **put in their place** because the overwhelming sense from these craven ghouls is that they believe that workers got given way too much and were treated too well
- The whole [Quiet Quitting fiasco](https://ez.substack.com/p/quiet-quitting-crony-capitalism) upset them - the idea that workers would take the same liberties with what a work day was (doing what they were required to do versus working beyond their contractually-mandated hours) that executives do was truly offensive - and the idea that workers could choose where to take their talents was equally noxious
- The next year will be one where the business elite (and the media in tow) attempts to reframe a **rough [[economy]]** as a time that puts workers in their place. Boss erotica author and reporter for the Wall Street Journal Chip Cutter's **[The Bosses Are Back In Charge](https://www.wsj.com/articles/layoffs-labor-market-bosses-power-workplace-11675347655)** is one of the more vulgar attempts I've seen to try and crush remote work, quoting a real estate CEO - a guy who profits from offices - as saying that **the whole concept of working from anywhere went too far.** The goal with these stories is to pump out marketing material for professionally abusive executives, with a partner at PWC saying that **There is a segment of CEOs who are like, 'All right, I got the power back,** a statement that he claims **he doesn't share** despite saying the words in the Wall Street Journal
- The truth is that these bosses remain terrified because even though there are market forces that are making workers a bit more desperate, they still have no justification for returning to the office
