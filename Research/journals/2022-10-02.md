## Personal Research

- After reading some Productivity books, they all feel pretty same and lame. I want to read a good novel.

## Interesting Websites

- [Lapce Pre-alpha Stage Lightning-fast and Powerful Code Editor](https://lapce.dev/)
  - Tried it, but it was a clunky interface, sadly.
- Got an email from the [[WorkerDOM]] team that the [[project]] will not have any major updates
