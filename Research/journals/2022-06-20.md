[[Cloudflare]]. [Private Access Tokens: eliminating CAPTCHAs on iPhones and Macs with open standards](https://blog.cloudflare.com/eliminating-captchas-on-iphones-and-macs-using-new-standard/)

- A completely invisible, private way to validate that real users are visiting your site.
- This will eliminate nearly 100% of CAPTCHAs served to these users.
- Usability aside, mobile environments present an additional challenge in that they are increasingly [[API]]-driven. CAPTCHAs cannot work in an [[API]] environment where [[JavaScript]] can't be rendered or a WebView can't be called.

Note that this is not [[Apple]] [[Passkey]]. This is the Privacy Pass standard. [[Apple]] [[Passkey]] is a [[Passkey|FIDO]] alliance.
