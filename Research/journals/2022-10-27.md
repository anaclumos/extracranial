### [[Apple vs Spotify]]

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p lang="en" dir="ltr">

Seriously is <a href="https://twitter.com/Spotify?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Spotify</a> complaining about being fair. Take a look at yourselves first. The effect of your ultra-low payout system on musicians is decimating grassroots music. Perhaps <a href="https://twitter.com/Apple?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Apple</a> are doing audiobook creators a favour and protecting them from that awful company.

Can artists have their own payment system within Spotify?<br/>Can artists include links in Spotify to purchase their products outside of Spotify.<br/>Perhaps Spotify could lead by example, opening their platform to third parties and remove content rules?
