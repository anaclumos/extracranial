### [[Apple vs Spotify]]

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

Seriously is [@Spotify](https://twitter.com/Spotify?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) complaining about being fair. Take a look at yourselves first. The effect of your ultra-low payout system on musicians is decimating grassroots music. Perhaps [@Apple](https://twitter.com/Apple?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) are doing audiobook creators a favour and protecting them from that awful company.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

Can artists have their own payment system within Spotify?<br/>Can artists include links in Spotify to purchase their products outside of Spotify.<br/>Perhaps Spotify could lead by example, opening their platform to third parties and remove content rules?
