Watched [[J. Robert Oppenheimer|Oppenheimer]]. I was continuously disturbed by the fact that the greatest scientist and theorist ever can also be easily depleted and destroyed by the turbulence of the global powers. Also, I was continuously thinking of the connections between [[Robert Oppenheimer and Jiro Horikoshi]].
