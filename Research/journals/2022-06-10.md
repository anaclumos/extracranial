- [Microsoft Announces It Will Include Pay Ranges In All United States of America Job Postings. Experts Predict It Will Be The First Of Many.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/gradsoflife/2022/03/31/3-ways-companies-can-advance-diversity-equity--inclusion-beyond-their-own-four-walls/?sh=5fd11bc53721)
  - [[Microsoft]] [said Wednesday](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2022/06/08/microsoft-announces-four-new-employee-workforce-initiatives/ 'https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2022/06/08/microsoft-announces-four-new-employee-workforce-initiatives/') it will include pay ranges in all of its [[United States of America|U.S.]] job listings, a move that likely foreshadows a range of big corporations following suit, experts say, as competition for talent remains high.
  - [[Microsoft]]'s [blog post](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2022/06/08/microsoft-announces-four-new-employee-workforce-initiatives/ 'https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2022/06/08/microsoft-announces-four-new-employee-workforce-initiatives/') also said it was removing noncompete clauses from its [[United States of America|U.S.]] employee agreements, and will not enforce existing clauses in the [[United States of America|U.S.]], with the exception of executives in senior leadership roles, as well making some changes to its separation agreements.

- [MIT researchers uncover 'unpatchable' flaw in Apple M1 chips](https://techcrunch.com/2022/06/10/apple-m1-unpatchable-flaw/)
  - In a [[proof of concept]], the [[Researcher|researchers]] demonstrated that the attack even works against the kernel — the software core of a device's operating system — which has **massive implications for future security work on all [[ARM Architecture|ARM]] systems with pointer authentication enabled,** says Joseph Ravichandran, a [[Ph.D.|PhD]] student at MIT CSAIL and co-lead author of the research paper.
  - [[Apple]] has [implemented pointer authentication](https://support.apple.com/guide/security/operating-system-integrity-sec8b776536b/1/web/1#sec0167b469d) on all of its custom [[ARM Architecture|ARM]]-based silicon so far, including the M1, M1 Pro and M1 Max, and a number of other chip manufacturers, including Qualcomm and Samsung, have either announced or are expected to ship new processors supporting the hardware-level security feature. MIT said it has not yet tested the attack on [Apple's unreleased M2 chip](https://techcrunch.com/2022/06/06/apple-announces-the-m2/), which also supports pointer authentication.
  - In May last year, a developer [discovered an unfixable flaw in Apple's M1 chip](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/05/apples-m1-chip-has-a-security-bug-but-dont-worry-its-mostly-harmless/) that creates a covert channel that two or more already installed malicious apps could use to transmit information to each other. But the bug was ultimately deemed **harmless** as malware can't use it to steal or interfere with data that's on a Mac.
