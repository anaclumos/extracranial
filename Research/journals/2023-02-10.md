- [ChatGPT Is a Blurry JPEG of the Web](https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/chatgpt-is-a-blurry-jpeg-of-the-web). Think of ChatGPT as a blurry _jpeg_ of all the text on the Web. It retains much of the information on the Web, in the same way that a _jpeg_ has much of the knowledge of a higher-resolution image, but if you're looking for an exact sequence of bits, you won't find it; all you will ever get is an approximation. But, because the approximation is presented in the form of grammatical text, which ChatGPT excels at creating, it's usually acceptable. So you're still looking at a blurry _jpeg_, but the blurriness occurs in a way that doesn't make the picture as a whole look less sharp.
