1. There's an [open-source Android browser](https://github.com/hazuki0x0/YuzuBrowser) (now seemingly abandoned) that implements ad-blocking functionality.
2. This [[Web Browser|browser]] is forked by a couple of other [[Web Browser|browsers]] that are very popular in India.
3. The problem is that this [[Web Browser|browser]] has a severe flaw. It tries to download filter updates on **every startup**, and on [[Android]], it may happen many times daily. It can even happen when the [[Web Browser|browser]] is running in the background.
