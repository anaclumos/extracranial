> The canvas element is part of HTML5 and allows for dynamic, scriptable rendering of 2D shapes and [[Bitmap Graphic|bitmap images]]. It is a low level, procedural model that updates a [[Bitmap Graphic|bitmap]]. HTML5 Canvas also helps in making 2D games. While the HTML5 canvas offers its own 2D drawing [[API]], it also supports the WebGL [[API]] to allow [[3D]] rendering with OpenGL ES.
