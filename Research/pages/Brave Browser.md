Brave is a free and open-source [[web browser]] that is focused on privacy. It is based on [[Chromium]], the same technology used by [[Google]] for [[Chrome]] and [[Microsoft]] for [[Edge]]. Brave automatically blocks some ads and website trackers in its default settings. It also blocks third-party data storage, [[Web Browser|browser]] fingerprinting, and some malware and phishing attempts.

However, Brave introduced more bugs than [[Chrome]].
