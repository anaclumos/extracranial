- VP9 and HEVC are video compression standards that aim to reduce the file size and bandwidth of 4K videos.
- [[Apple]] only supports HEVC, while [[Google]] only supports VP9.
- We used to be able to watch 4K YouTube videos encoded in H264 in ~2016. [[Google]] switched to VP9 only for 4K videos, essentially banning 4K videos on [[Apple]] Safari and iOS YouTube.
- Not only that, macOS devices only got VP9 decoders in MacBook Pro 2019. Technically we could watch 4K+ videos using Chrome on MacBooks, but the videos were decoded on [[CPU|CPUs]], using the [[CPU]] 400%.
- Starting iOS 14, [[Apple]] added VP9 support; [[Google]] eventually won. Now we can play 4K videos on macOS Safari and iOS YouTube using this. [[Apple]] [[GPU]] also now supports VP9 decoding.
- Similar to [[USDZ vs glTF]]
