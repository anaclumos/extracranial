An idea suggested on [[2022-07-14]] that all inventions should be _fiercely overpriced_.

To attain [[FIRE]], we have previously explored that [[Software as a Service]] would be one way to go.
However, good _engineering_ and good _product_ differ significantly.
One major roadblock would be the lack of expertise in payment infra.
What if we start from a _simple_ yet _overpriced_ [[Software as a Service]] product to test how to get monetized?
The purpose is not to generate revenue by itself but to examine and get enough data out on how the real-world [[Software as a Service]] [[FIRE]] will work out.

**Examples**.
A book recommendation web app, but _you need to pay to use it_.
[[Book Metadata as a Service]] could also be one example.

Avi Wilensky, a web developer from [[New York City]], narrates his experience creating and monetizing the Up Hail web application, a comparison site for ride-sharing services and taxis. Initially, Wilensky built the website as a weekend side project to fulfill a niche need he identified.
