Thoughts on [[2023-07-12]]

- People I follow on [[Twitter]] are **not** my high school friends I follow on [[Instagram]].
- Having instant 100 followers may seem significant on paper, but that also means it would be **hard to overturn.** Even if I follow more tech people on Threads, I am still less likely to see relevant content because I was subscribed to a massive uninteresting group
- Plus, many people, especially outside of the core tech bubble, have different **persona** on [[Instagram|Insta]] and [[Twitter]]. Not a wise idea to merge the two.
- This inertia will eventually lead to an uninteresting platform and be a mediocre platform at best, IMO.
- The significant contributor would be the [[Fediverse]]. If they can interoperate with the [[AT protocol]] ([[Bluesky]]), [[ActivityPub]] protocol ([[Mastodon]]), and the [[Matrix Network]] (Instant Messaging Standard), Threads will have a chance.
- But the [[Fediverse]] Zuck is trying to advertise seems like a PR show to enter the [[EU]] market with minimum regulations. [[Meta (Company)|FB]] will [[Meta (Company)|FB]] anyways, which won't likely happen.
