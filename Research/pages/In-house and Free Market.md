> Can In-house out-beat Open Competition?
> If so, at what cost?

In-house research and free market competition are two different approaches to research, each with advantages and disadvantages. In-house research can provide greater control and confidentiality over the research process, while free market competition leads to more rapid innovation and lower consumer prices. **Can this apply to individual levels as well**?

**In-house: high schools**.
This is a question I asked at [[민사고|KMLA]].
It was much of an isolated society, almost making it impossible to find someone deeply fascinated by technology (at least back in 2016-ish. Now there's an AI/CS boom, which surprises me.)
I was in an isolated society with limited in-house research and development resources.
Of course, I do not think that was necessarily a bad thing.
Thankfully, I [[antifragily]] acquired uniqueness and my style.

**Open Competition: universities**.
On the other hand, I am in a free market competition at a university that involves competition among students for funding, recognition, and academic positions: a stimulating and dynamic environment that fosters innovation and encourages researchers and students to strive for excellence in their work. Wouldn't this be the best edge of being in a University?

**In-house: enterprise research centers**.
While universities are often collaborative environments where researchers exchange ideas and work together to advance knowledge, company research centers often focus on developing new products or improving existing ones to generate profit for the company. As such, company research centers have access to more financial resources, technology, and expertise than universities, enabling them to impact new technologies' development significantly.
In recent years, much of the research and development in many fields has shifted away from individual efforts towards collaborative research in company labs. This is due to several factors, including the increased focus on commercialization and profit-driven innovation and the need to develop new technologies to keep up with competitors rapidly. It is known that internal labs like Google's are already at least several years ahead of the available research but do not publish them to heat the competition.

Then it poses a concerning question:

> Can independent scientists ever win again?
> At what cost?
> Can we democratize **science** again?

That said, it's the best time to do independent research.

**Open-Competition: The Internet**.

The internet provides a platform for independent scientists to share their research findings and connect with other researchers, regardless of their location. This fosters collaboration and provides access to broader perspectives and expertise. Additionally, the internet has enabled independent scientists to access a wealth of information and resources previously only available to larger organizations or institutions. Online resources such as open-access journals, scientific databases, and research forums provide independent scientists with the tools they need to conduct high-quality research.

Moreover, the internet has also enabled new ways of funding and crowdsourcing research, allowing independent scientists to access financial support from a broader range of sources, including individual donors and foundations.

Basically, if you have a computer, nothing can stop you.

## The need for a Neo Infrastructure

Maybe we need better infrastructure for internet-based, openly-competitive research infrastructure. Making and publishing thoughtful insights and research on the web should be more accessible. This [[Memex]] is one branch of that thought.
