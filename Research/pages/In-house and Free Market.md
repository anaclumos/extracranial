> Can In-house out-beat Open Competition?
> If so, at what cost?

In-house research and free market competition are two different approaches to research, each with advantages and disadvantages. In-house research can provide greater control and confidentiality over the research process, while free market competition leads to more rapid innovation and lower consumer prices. **Can this apply to individual levels as well**?

**In-house: high schools**.
This is a question I asked at [[민사고|KMLA]].
It was much of an isolated society, almost making it impossible to find someone deeply fascinated by technology (at least back in 2016-ish. Now there's an AI/CS boom, which surprises me.)
I was in an isolated society with limited in-house research and development resources.
Of course, I do not think that was necessarily a bad thing.
Thankfully, I [[antifragily]] acquired uniqueness and my style.

**Open Competition: universities**.
On the other hand, I am in a free market competition at a university that involves competition among students for funding, recognition, and academic positions: a stimulating and dynamic environment that fosters innovation and encourages researchers and students to strive for excellence in their work. Wouldn't this be the best edge of being in a University?

**In-house: enterprise research centers**.
Company research centers, unlike universities, focus on developing profitable products using their greater financial resources, technology, and expertise. Collaborative research in company labs has become more prevalent as a result of the focus on commercialization and profit-driven innovation, with internal labs being years ahead of available research. For instance, Google's internal labs keep their cutting-edge research unpublished to maintain a competitive edge.

Then it poses a concerning question:

> Can independent scientists ever win again?
> At what cost?
> Can we democratize **science** again?

That said, it's the best time to do independent research.

**Open-Competition: The Internet**.
The internet has transformed the landscape of scientific research by providing independent scientists with the tools they need to pursue their research goals, including online resources such as open-access journals, scientific databases, and research forums. With the ability to share their findings, collaborate, access resources, and obtain funding, independent scientists have the potential to make significant contributions to scientific progress and innovation. You can do anything if you have your laptop.

## The need for a Neo Infrastructure

Maybe we need better infrastructure for internet-based, openly-competitive research infrastructure. Making and publishing thoughtful insights and research on the web should be more accessible. This [[Memex]] is one branch of that thought.
