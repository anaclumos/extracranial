> Can In-house out-beat Open Competition?
> If so, at what cost?
> Can independent scientists ever win again?
> Can we democratize **science** again?

In-house & free market research have pros & cons. In-house offers more control & confidentiality, while the free market promotes innovation & lower prices. **Can this apply to individual levels as well?**

- **In-house**. my [[민사고|high school]] society with limited in-house research resources, making it hard to find tech enthusiasts. Although this wasn't necessarily bad, I was surprised by the recent boom in [[AI]]/CS. Despite the limitations, I [[antifragily]] developed my unique style.
- **Open Market**. Universities offer a free market competition environment where students compete for funding, recognition, and academic positions. This fosters innovation, encourages excellence, and creates a dynamic and stimulating environment for researchers and students. It's arguably the best edge of being in a University.
- **In-house**. Company research centers prioritize profits and innovation. Internal labs are ahead of published research for a competitive edge. For instance, [[Google]]'s internal labs keep their cutting-edge research unpublished to maintain a competitive edge. This raises concerns about independent scientists and science democratization, but it's still a good time for independent study because...
- **Open Market**. The internet revolutionized scientific research for independent scientists with access to online resources. Collaboration, sharing, funding, and contributions to scientific progress and innovation are possible with a laptop and internet connection.

Maybe we need better infrastructure for internet-based, openly-competitive research infrastructure. Making and publishing thoughtful insights and research on the web should be more accessible. This [[Memex]] is one branch of that thought.
