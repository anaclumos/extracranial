- [[Mail|Letter]] to Mr. [[Matt Rickard]] on 2022-10-03

Dear Mr. Rickard,

Awesome article. I want to give one good example of Screenshots-as-an-[[API]].

Unlike the Western market, the [[한민족|Korean]] music market is heavily independent.
Although YouTube Music has gobbled up the market cap quite significantly, most people still use [[한민족|Korean]] services to listen to music, primarily due to copyright issues for foreign Music services (they don't have [[한민족|Korean]] songs).
That being said, Spotify and [[Apple]] Music have a market penetration of next to nothing.

There are two behemoths in [[대한민국|Korea]], [[Naver]], and [[Kakao]].
[[Naver]] services as the omnipotent search [[engine]] for [[대한민국|Korea]] (bigger market cap than [[Google]] [[대한민국|Korea]]) and [[Kakao]] services as an almighty chatting app (more than 95% of [[한민족|Koreans]] use it).
They always fight each other for market superiority.

[[Kakao]] currently operates the #1 music streaming service, Melon.
In 2019, [[Naver]] released a new music streaming service, Vibe, akin to Spotify in terms of interface and functionality.
At the time, Melon had a notorious lock-in for music playlists to deter users from escaping to other platforms.
Melon had no APIs, SSOs, or Access Tokens, not to mention prohibiting all sorts of copy-paste and data extraction.

[[Naver]] eventually released a feature where users could screenshot the playlist to port out playlists from melon.
It was a clever move that did not violate any law restrictions or terms of use.
I attached a translated article and video for you.
The video is in [[한민족|Korean]], but it's a 30-second visual tutorial video, so you'll get the feeling.

The [[한민족|Korean]] tech market has these random unheard intriguing stories.
I'm at @anaclumos on [[GitHub]], [[Twitter]], and any other platform.
Hope we can keep in touch.

Best Regards,
Sunghyun Cho
