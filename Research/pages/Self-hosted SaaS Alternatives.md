## [Self-Hosted SaaS Alternatives: Replacing Paid Tools With FOSS Tools](https://tedium.co/2023/03/04/self-hosted-saas-app-alternatives/)

### Self-hosted [[Google Analytics]] [[Alternative|alternatives]]

- Too hot: [Umami](https://app.umami.is/share/8rmHaheU/umami.is) is slightly warmer than the winner in this category and is quite similar in many ways. However, Umami's hosted cloud service is not ready for mainstream use yet, giving its competitor the edge. But watch this space.
- Too cold: [Matomo](https://matomo.org/) is only a little more complicated than the [[Alternative|alternatives]], not by much. It's still quite good. Its interface, [which can be viewed in demo form here](https://demo.matomo.cloud/), is more like [[Google Analytics]] than the [[Alternative|alternatives]], but in a way that makes sense.
- Just right: [Plausible](https://plausible.io) strikes the perfect balance in cost and usability. The company makes an open-source version that is quite good but also offers a paid version that costs enough that you know you're the customer, not the product. Easy to set up and friendly to use.
- Outside the box: You could always do with [[Mastodon]] does and eschew analytics entirely.

### Self-hosted [[Mail|Email]] newsletter platforms

- Too hot: [Keila](https://www.keila.io), a very-polished-looking [[Mail|email]] sender that will fit many users' needs, but its emphasis on a single flexible template makes it difficult to recommend for power users. (They are working on it, howeverâ€”and the team seemed responsive to feedback.) [Sendportal](https://sendportal.io) also has potential, but the fact it hasn't been updated in more than a year gives us pause.
- Too cold: [Mailtrain](https://github.com/Mailtrain-org/mailtrain) has most of the features one might expect out of an [[Mail|email]]-sending tool, including power-user features like support for MJML, but its user interface can feel imposing to new users. A less-imposing but still-complex [[alternative]] is [Mautic](https://www.mautic.org).
- Just right: [Listmonk](https://listmonk.app) has a clean interface and lightweight feature set. It lacks some bells and whistles that some users might expect, like on-the-fly segmentation, but it's closer to being a daily driver than any other tool in this category.
- Outside the box: Hosting something through your [[CMS]] is a good idea. [Ghost](https://ghost.org), while not anywhere near as full-featured as the other tools mentioned for [[Mail|email]] use cases, strikes a good balance for the average creator.

### Self-hosted Zapier [[Alternative|alternatives]]

- Too hot: [Automatisch](https://automatisch.io) is the closest thing to a direct open-source variant of Zapier at this time, as its design carries the spirit of the paid tool's interface, but it is brand new, having just launched only in November, and doesn't have many apps. It feels like one to watch, though. However, unlike other options, it falls under a standard AGPL license. So I had no trouble installing this locally.
- Too cold: [N8n](https://n8n.io) has the correct number of apps, a larger community, and is much more mature than many of its competitors, but its less-intuitive design is potentially a turnoff. (Despite being free to self-host via a community option, it also [does not have an open-source license](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/LICENSE.md).) It can be run inside a desktop application, which is a plus.
- Just right: [ActivePieces](https://www.activepieces.com) seems to have the right momentum to get things going in a good direction; it also has a reasonably priced cloud option, and while it is still new, it has a lot of potential and a quickly growing app list. (It, too, [doesn't use](https://github.com/activepieces/activepieces/blob/main/packages/ee/LICENSE) a pure GPL-style license, however. Another responsive-to-feedback team, however.)
- Outside the box: If your goal is automating some basic tasks, the [[Web Browser|browser]] extension [Automa](https://www.automa.site) also has much potential.

### Self-hosted Calendly [[Alternative|alternatives]]

- Too hot: [Cal. Com](https://cal.com) has a lot of potential to make many people's lives more accessible; it's not only a helpful tool, but it also appears to be relatively modern and offers a natural [[alternative]] to the dance of trying to book a meeting. That means it is not embarrassing to use when you're trying to set up an appointment. But I'm not recommending it because, at least now, it fails at the fundamental hurdle of being self-hostable, in part. After all, it uses a very temperamental and very modern application stack.
- Outside the box: If you're a [NextCloud](https://midrange.tedium.co/issues/cloudy-with-a-chance-of-diy/) user, [there's a decent appointment app](https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/appointments) that you can add to the application that covers most of Calendly's primary use cases. Granted, it's nowhere near as good as Calendly and doesn't seamlessly integrate into Zoom, but unlike Cal.com, you can install it without ripping out your hair.
