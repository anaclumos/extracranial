미래의 한 기기를 상상해 보십시오... 자신의 모든 책, 기록, 그리고 대화를 저장할 수 있는 장치를 말입니다.
그것은 동시에 기계화되어, 매우 빠르고 유연하게 정보를 참조할 수 있을 것입니다.
그것은 기억의 확장이자... 기억의 친밀한 보조 장치일 것입니다. — [[Vannevar Bush|버니바 부시]].

Consider a future device … in which an individual stores all his books, records, and communications, which is mechanized so that it may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility.
It is an enlarged intimate supplement to his memory. — [[Vannevar Bush]].

> In "[[As We May Think]]", [[Vannevar Bush]] describes a memex as an electromechanical device enabling individuals to develop and read a large self-contained research library, create and follow associative trails of links and personal annotations, and recall these trails at any time to share them with other researchers. This device would closely mimic the associative processes of the human mind, but it would be gifted with permanent recollection. As Bush writes, "Thus science may implement how man produces, stores, and consults the record of the race". [Memex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memex)

- Synonym with [[Extracranial]], Digital Brain, Second Brain, etc.
