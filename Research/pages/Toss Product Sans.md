- [[Font]] by [[Toss]].
- Looks bizarrely similar to [[San Francisco]]

## Usage

```css
@import url('https://static.toss.im/tps/main.css');
@import url('https://static.toss.im/tps/others.css');

* {
  font-family: 'Toss Product Sans';
}
```

- I figured it did not support [[Font Feature]].
- Also, [[Toss]] Employee once told me not to use it 😔
