A Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA), also known as a confidentiality agreement, is a legally binding contract between two parties that establishes a confidential relationship. The party or parties signing the agreement agree not to disclose specified information they have shared as a necessary part of doing business together. NDAs are commonly used to protect proprietary information, trade secrets, business strategies, or intellectual property.
