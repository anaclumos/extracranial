- In 2017, I saw too many Chatbot [[AI]] startups. Then in 2018, they suddenly disappeared.

### [Human-in-the-Loop and Other AI Mistakes](https://matt-rickard.ghost.io/human-in-the-loop-and-other-ai-mistakes/)

- > The performance of deep neural networks scales with data and compute. Extrapolating 2016 results over the next few years shows that we'll have ubiquitous human-level conversational [[AI]] and other sophisticated agents.
- > To prepare for this, we'll be first-to-market by selling the same services today except with humans that the models augment. While this will initially be a loss leader, it will be mighty once the models are good enough to solely power the interaction (without humans). By then, we'll have the best distribution.
- Of course, we still don't have the level of conversational [[AI]] that can power magic assistants or chatbots without a human-in-the-loop. Most of these startups ran out of money. The most successful ones were the ones that sold to strategic buyers (Cruise/GM, Otto/Uber, Zoox/Amazon) or ones that sold picks and shovels (Scale AI).
- We don't seem to be making the same mistakes as in 2016 in the era of [[generative AI]]. Some companies are solving for distribution using someone else's proprietary model (e.g., Jasper AI/GPT-3), but these products deliver real value to customers today â€“ with no human in the loop. If LLM performance plateaued, these companies would likely still have some intrinsic value.
