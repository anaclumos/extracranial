âœ¨ I upscaled a 64x64 pixel image to 37 Megapixels ðŸ¤¯

Workflow: the new Clarity AI Low Res for upscaling from 64 to 1024px and Clarity AI regular for 1024 to 6144px.

I made both models open-source and am now implementing the low-resolution option to my app http://ClarityAI.cc, so users can also upscale very low-resolution images to up to 37 Megapixels with one click.

So, I need to add a x100 option ðŸ¤©
