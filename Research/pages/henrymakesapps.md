Recently, the creator of juchamatjib.com and hellynee.com built both websites within 48 hours using the following tech stack, with speed being the primary criterion for selecting the technologies:

1. [[Next.js]]. Used for both [[front-end]] and server-side development.
2. [[tRPC]]. Simplifies server-client communication without needing REST or [[GraphQL]].
3. [[Tailwind]] [[CSS]]. Reduces time spent on styling decisions while maintaining design quality.
4. [[Supabase]]. Offers an easy-to-use [[database]] with PostgreSQL and type-injected clients.
5. [[AWS]] Copilot: Provides hosting for the [[Next.js]] projects on ECS.
6. tsconfig.json `strict: false` option: Allows faster development by fixing errors as they occur rather than prioritizing type safety.

These tools allowed the developer to create the websites quickly and efficiently.
