A UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) is a 128-bit value or 36-character alphanumeric string that can be used to identify information across a computer system. UUIDs are designed to be globally unique and are often used to identify rows of data within a [[database]] table, where each row is assigned a specific UUID. For example, most mobile devices have a unique ID, also called a UUID, assigned at the time of manufacture for identification purposes. UUIDs are sometimes called "GUID" or "Globally Unique Identifiers". The term "GUID" is also used, mostly in [[Microsoft]] systems. The specification for UUIDs was originally created by [[Microsoft]] and standardized by both the IETF and ITU.
