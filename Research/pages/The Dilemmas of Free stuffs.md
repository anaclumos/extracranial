I hate bullshit.

So I hate to charge people for sharing knowledge.

I especially despise when people sell "how I got rich"

But... awkwardly enough, people link the product's value with the price they pay. For example, if they paid $49 for a book, they will likely pay more profound attention to the content and carefully review it, compared to when they got it for free.
