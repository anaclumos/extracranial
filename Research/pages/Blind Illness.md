### [These Young Workers Are **Romanticizing** the Return to Office](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/27/business/tiktok-office-influencers.html)

- Some are more modest, showing lunches eaten alone in gray cubicles and office coffee whose quality we can guess at, while others flaunt luxe décor and amenities like gyms and catered dining
