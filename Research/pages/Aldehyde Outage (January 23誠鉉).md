## [[Docusaurus]] 2.3.0 `useSyncExternalStore` Bug

[Using Tabs will break with React 18 and Docusaurus v2.3 · Issue #8592 · facebook/docusaurus](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/issues/8592#event-8378524686)

## [[Vercel]] and [[Cloudflare]] Build Errors

On [[Cloudflare]]'s side:

```
16:49:17.136	✔ Server: Compiled successfully in 3.74m
16:50:22.579	Segmentation fault
16:50:22.595	Failed: build command exited with code: 139
16:50:23.859	Failed: an internal error occurred
```

On [[Vercel]]'s Side:

```
[success] [webpackbar] Server: Compiled successfully in 3.49m
Error: Command "yarn run build" exited with 129
```

Why..? I changed no config

Investigating RAM Options. Supported a ticket to [[Cloudflare]]

```
--max-old-space-size=4096
```

Did not help.

OH FIGURED IT OUT.
It was because of insufficient RAM.
When [[Docusaurus]] seals the assets (at the end of the build cycle), the RAM usage spikes to ~4.5 GB.

Configuring [[Cloudflare Pages]] and [[Vercel]] with the following argument fixed the problem!

```
--max-old-space-size=8192
```

— Nope. Did not solve the problem.

So I ended up using [[Cloudflare]] Wrangler to build on my device and then sending the build result to [[Cloudflare]]. Anyways, the issue seems to be resolved.
