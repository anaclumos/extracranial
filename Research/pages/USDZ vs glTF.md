[[USDZ]] and [[glTF]] are two [[3D]] file formats used for different purposes. [[USDZ]] is a subset of USD, created by Pixar and operated by [[Apple]] for iOS AR applications. It is a zip file with USD and image files. [[glTF]] is a transmission format for [[3D]] assets well suited to the web and mobile devices. It removes unimportant data for efficient support display and employs compression algorithms to reduce file size.

[[USDZ]] has some limitations compared to [[glTF]], such as no geometry-specific compression, texture channel packing, and zip compression feature. However, it may have some advantages in terms of interoperability and scalability with other USD files.

[[Apple]] uses [[USDZ]] for iOS AR applications, but Android does not support [[USDZ]] yet. Android has its equivalents, [[glTF]] and GLB, which are more suitable for web and mobile devices. However, it is possible to convert [[USDZ]] and [[glTF]] using tools like Reality Converter. Also, there may be differences in rendering quality and tracking performance between [[Apple]] and Android devices when using AR.
