I always wondered how ABS worked. It's straightforwardâ€”there is a high-frequency vibrator next to the break that will grab the break for a second and then let go and then grab and then let go. How ingenious design! That way, you get stationary friction instead of kinetic friction, plus being able to steer while skidding.
