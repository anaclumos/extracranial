A multi-agent large-language-model system that functions as a virtual research collaborator.

It receives a research goal in natural language, retrieves and reads literature, and then enters an internal tournament of agents

- Generation (idea creation)
- Reflection (critique)
- Ranking (prioritization)
- Evolution (improvement)
- support agents for proximity checks
- meta-review

The agents debate at machine speed, iteratively refining candidate hypotheses and research plans until high-quality, novel proposals emerge.

Output consists of ranked, citation-grounded hypotheses and experimental designs that humans can directly test, compressing tasks that would occupy scientists for days into minutes while leaving physical experiments to human labs.
