- [Contentlayer](https://www.contentlayer.dev/)
- The Content layer SDK tool helps you process your content data (such as [[Markdown]] files or [[CMS]]) into type-safe [[JSON]] data that you can easily import into your application's pages. It also validates your content, generates type definitions, and outputs data objects ready to be imported as an ESM module.
