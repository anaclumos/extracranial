Copilot but instead of giving you the code block, gives you step-by-step instructions

- antipilot
- [[Copilot]] looks like increasing your productivity, but it
  - deteriorates your thinking powers
  - sneaks in a bug that you will spend 2x time to find out
    - People claim, "don't paste in stuff you don't understand."
    - But the **design** of the products seemingly encourages you to rely on and depend on the product.
  - [[In The End Trust Yourself]]
- [[Copilot]] is already unstoppable.
- [[Generative AI]] and [[LLM]] are already unstoppable. This is not to stop them.
- However, you should be worried about it.
