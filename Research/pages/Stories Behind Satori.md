The potential candidates for [[Satori]] included:

- [[Canvas (HTML5)|Canvas]]-based solutions lacked dynamic behaviors (e.g., layout) and APIs.
- [[Web Browser]]-based solutions were too slow
- [[SVG]]-based solutions were the perfect balance of the two, being fast and dev-friendly ([[HTML]]/[[CSS]])

However, [[SVG]] solutions lacked layout support.
Given that [[SVG]] and [[HTML]] + [[CSS]] are alike, we can convert [[HTML]] and [[CSS]] to [[SVG]].
We can calculate the elements' positions through a layout [[engine]] and convert them into [[SVG]] markups.

This is already done by an open-source [[project]] [facebook/yoga](https://github.com/facebook/yoga).
Converting it into [[WebAssembly|WASM]] will also benefit by targeting [[Web Worker|Web Workers]].
Using a [[WebAssembly|WASM]]-based approach also unlocked the possibility of running it on edge. [Introducing support for WebAssembly at the Edge](https://vercel.com/blog/introducing-support-for-webassembly-at-the-edge).

After simplifying the syntax with [[JSX]] and simple [[CSS]], Shu used [RazrFalcon/resvg](https://github.com/RazrFalcon/resvg) and [yisibl/resvg-js](https://github.com/yisibl/resvg-js) to convert the [[SVG]] image to [[PNG]].

The [[Vercel]] team [[Dogfooding|dogfooded]] this for a while.
They also added [[Google]] [[Font]]'s `?text=` [[API]], containing a specific subset of the [[CJK]] library and rendering things on the fly.
The same applies to [[Emoji|emojis]].
