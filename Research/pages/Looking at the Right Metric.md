_you should look at your speedometer when driving, and..._

Most of the time, looking at the right metric can make all the difference. For example, a social network app should grow exponentially by nature. Thus, you need to look at month-over-month percentage growth,

not the total registered users—it doesn't tell anything about the present

not the monthly active users—it doesn't capture the growth velocity

not the monthly increase in users—it doesn't capture the exponential network effect

not the pageview/interactions on the service—it doesn't capture the value proposition

not capital raised or rounds closed—VCs are not your customers.

Or even even looking at any metric might be a wrong choice. You may need one customer who loves your product. Again, it all depends on the context.
