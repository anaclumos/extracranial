- An [[Generative AI|Gen AI]] Experiment done by [SuppMon104](https://github.com/suppmon104)
- Tested [[Generative AI|generative AIs]] to create content for a fictional scenario involving Harry Potter and Donald Trump.
- Utilized various [[AI]] tools for character design, voice generation, and [[animation]].
- Although facing challenges in the process, the result was satisfactory.

## Key Points

1. Used [[ChatGPT]] to generate prompts for dressing 10 Harry Potter characters in 1990s Balenciaga fashion pieces.
2. Used [[Midjourney]] to create character images, but getting the desired image was difficult, with mid-quality results being more straightforward than high-quality ones.
3. Used [[Eleven Labs]] for voice generation. Extracting a good voice for Donald Trump proved challenging and time-consuming, and the result could have been better.
4. [[D-ID]] was used for [[animation]], with no issues encountered.

## Challenges and Considerations

1. In voice generation, finding noise-free training data can be complex. The process can be labor-intensive, requiring multiple iterations to achieve the desired tone and quality.
2. The generated script's pacing and pauses may not match the user's expectations, resulting in a defective final product.
3. Using the voice of a character like Harry Potter proved difficult due to the need for more distinctiveness in the adult version of the character's voice. Characters with more recognizable voices may yield better results.
