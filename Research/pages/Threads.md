Not to be confused with [[Threads (Service)]]

In computer science, a thread is a minor sequence of programmed instructions that can be managed independently by a scheduler, typically a part of the operating system. Threads are a way for a program to divide (concurrent) itself into two or more simultaneously (or pseudo-simultaneously) running tasks.
