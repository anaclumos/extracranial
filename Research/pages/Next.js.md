> Next.js is an open-source web development framework created by Vercel enabling [[React]]-based web applications with server-side rendering and generating static websites. [[React]] documentation mentions Next.js among "Recommended Toolchains," advising it to developers as a solution when "Building a server-rendered website with Node.js". Where traditional [[React]] apps can only render their content in the client-side browser, Next.js extends this functionality to include applications rendered on the server side. The copyright and trademarks for Next.js are owned by Vercel, which also maintains and leads its open-source development. [Next.js](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Next.js)
