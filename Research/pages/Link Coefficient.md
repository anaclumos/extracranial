Given a [[database]], how interconnected is the [[database]]?

## Key Idea

Given $n$ nodes, there can be $n(n-1) \over 2$ total possible links if every single node is connected to the other. How many links exist compared to that fully-linked [[database]]?

$$
\text{Link Coefficient} = {\text{Existing Number of Links} \over \text{Total Possible Number of Links}}
$$

For example, as of [[2023-02-16]], [[Aldehyde]] has a 0.592% of Link Coefficient.
