우리의 목표는 [[Small yet Powerful|강소]]기업이다.

> "I want to write a book, if only because I see so much bullshit going around in the world of startups and tech. The media is presenting startups in the wrong way. People think they need to build billion-dollar companies. They must fly to San Francisco, build a "network," and get a 10 million dollar investment from old rich guys. They need to hire [[10x]] power developers and work them for 100-hour work weeks while feeding them pizza and soda. It will be great, they said.
