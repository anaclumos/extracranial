### [How Ahrefs Saved US$400M in 3 Years by NOT Going to the Cloud](https://tech.ahrefs.com/how-ahrefs-saved-us-400m-in-3-years-by-not-going-to-the-cloud-8939dd930af8)

- Ahrefs has a rented colocation data center in Singapore with a relatively homogenous infrastructure
- Ahrefs has saved ~USD 400 million by ensuring its infrastructure is NOT 100% in the IaaS cloud during the last 2½ years. This figure is growing more prominent as we start another massive colocation data center with new hardware.
- But with the mass layoffs in Big Tech in recent months, this may be an opportunity to re-evaluate the approach to the cloud, consider a reverse migration from the cloud, and hire seasoned professionals of the data center world
- If you start a new company, consider buying a rack and server and putting them in your basement. That might improve your sustainability from day one.
