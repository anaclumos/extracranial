NPM stands for Node Package Manager, which is the default package manager for the [[JavaScript]] runtime environment [[Node.js]]. NPM is used to install, share, and distribute code and to manage dependencies in your projects. It provides an online repository for hosting and sharing these packages and a command-line utility for interacting with this repository.
