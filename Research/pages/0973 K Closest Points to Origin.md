[K Closest Points to Origin - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/k-closest-points-to-origin/description/)

## Question

Given an array of `points` where `points[i] = [xi, yi]` represents a point on the **X-Y** plane and an integer `k`, return the `k` closest points to the origin `(0, 0)`.

The distance between two points on the **X-Y** plane is the Euclidean distance (i.e., `âˆš(x1 - x2)2 + (y1 - y2)2`).

You may return the answer in **any order**. The answer is **guaranteed** to be **unique** (except for the order that it is in).

## Solution

```swift
class Solution {
    func kClosest(_ points: [[Int]], _ k: Int) -> [[Int]] {
        var coordinates = points
        coordinates.sort {
            $0[0] * $0[0] + $0[1] * $0[1] < $1[0] * $1[0] + $1[1] * $1[1]
        }
        return Array(coordinates[...(k-1)])
    }
}
```
