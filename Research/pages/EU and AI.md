## [ChatGPT broke the EU plan to regulate AI](https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-plan-regulate-chatgpt-openai-artificial-intelligence-act/)

The EU is grappling with how to regulate general-purpose AI, such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, which can generate human-like text with no single intended use. The technology has upended work done on the EU's draft AI regulation, the Artificial Intelligence Act, which would designate some specific uses of AI as "high-risk," binding developers to stricter requirements of transparency, safety, and human oversight. The rise of ChatGPT is forcing EU institutions to rewrite their draft plans, and lead lawmakers on the AI Act are proposing stricter requirements on both developers and users of ChatGPT and similar AI models. Three-way negotiations between the European Commission, Council of the EU, and Parliament are expected to start in April at the earliest to hash out the details of a final AI Act, with big tech firms watching closely.
