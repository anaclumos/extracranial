### [Use.GPU Docs - Intro](https://usegpu.live/)

- Use.[[GPU]] is a set of **declarative, reactive WebGPU legos**. Compose live graphs, layouts, meshes, and shaders, on the fly
- It's a **stand-alone [[TypeScript]]+[[Rust]]/[[WebAssembly|WASM]] library** with its own [[React]]-like run-time. If you're familiar with [[React]], you will feel right at home
- It has a built-in **[[shader]] linker and binding generator**, which means a lot of the tedium of common [[GPU]] programming is eliminated without compromising on flexibility
