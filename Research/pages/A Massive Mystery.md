How faster would it get over time when you drop a random ball? Well â€” some AP Physics 1 level easy piece of cake. You have Newton's laws of motion, $F=ma$, and the force of the acting body due to gravity is $F={GMm \over r^2}$, so $a=g={GM \over r^2}$. Easy peasy.

But is it? The first $m$ in $F=ma$ is the **inertial mass**, and the second $m$ in $F={GMm \over r^2}$ is the **gravitational mass**. Einstein later expanded that these two masses are equal and stated it as a precondition to transforming general relativity to special relativity, known as the Einstein Equivalence Principle. While we empirically know that these two $m$s are equal, there's [no direct proof](http://dx.doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.18242.30402).

Scientists **believe** that Einstein is correct, based on many experiments conducted at ultra-microscopic-quantum levels. But it is yet to be discovered why those two $m$ **_must_** be equal, if:

- These two $m$s are the same physical value, and we are observing in two different ways due to some **[[Exquisite Geometric Nature of the Universe|exquisite geometric property of the universe]]**.
- Humans are just not accurate enough to disprove it yet.
