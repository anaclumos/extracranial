In [[statistics]], a normal table, also known as a [[standard normal]] table or a z-table, is a table that provides probabilities associated with the [[standard normal]] [[distribution]]. The table lists values of the [[standard normal]] [[distribution]]'s cumulative [[distribution]] function (CDF) for different values of the standardized variable Z.

A [[standard normal]] table typically provides probabilities for values of Z between -3.99 and 3.99 at intervals of 0.01. To use a [[standard normal]] table, one must find the corresponding row and column for a given Z-score and then read off the [[probability]] associated with that value of Z.

For example, if we want to find the [[probability]] of a Z-score less than or equal to 1.96, we would look for the row corresponding to 1.9 and the column corresponding to 0.06 in the [[standard normal]] table. The value at the intersection of the row and column is 0.9750, which indicates that the [[probability]] of a Z-score less than or equal to 1.96 is 0.9750, or 97.5%.

The [[standard normal]] table is helpful in statistical inference and hypothesis testing, where it is often used to calculate critical values and p-values associated with the [[standard normal]] [[distribution]]. It is also used to calculate confidence intervals and in various statistical models, such as linear and logistic regression.
