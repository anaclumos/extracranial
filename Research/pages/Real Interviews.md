## For 2023

### [Apple](https://apple.com)

- a lot of CS fundamental questions (e.g. what is a Hash Table (pros/cons)?)
- `isPalindrome` with a few edge cases

### [Palantir](https://www.palantir.com/)

- technical design of a class registration system (higher level engineering)
- technical design of a package manager proxy server (multithreading)

### [[Grammarly]]

- 1 Q on removing adjacent duplicates
  - simple $O(n^2)$ algorithm
  - improved to $O(n)$ algorithm using stack
  - can improve space complexity from now on but cannot improve time complexity.
- 1 Followup Q on removing length adjacent duplicates arbitrarily
  - $O(nk)$ algorithm
  - Had even more time left, so I discussed with the interviewer and improved to $O(n)$ algorithm 😃
- Learned that [[Grammarly]] has internal projects, Readerly (summarizing) and Speakerly ([[Generative Intelligence]])

### [Palantir](https://www.palantir.com/) with [Karat](https://karat.com/)

- 3 basic questions (analyzing algorithms and complexities)
- 3 [[Leetcode]] Easy to Medium Problem
  - Question involved constructing trees and traversing them
  - Each question is built on top of previous queries, getting gradually harder.
  - However, the most challenging question was still [[Leetcode]] Medium level.

### [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/) with [Karat](https://karat.com/)

- 3 basic questions (analyzing algorithms and complexities)
- 1 [[Leetcode]] Hard level question
  - Involved in Game State Change, Constructing Adjacency List of Game States, and Pathfinding
  - Given a Game Board, find a list of moves from the start state to the end state

### [Databricks](https://www.databricks.com/)

- 2 1-hour interview
  - 1 conceptual, technical design (data pipelines & tradeoffs)
  - 1 conditional [[BFS]] problem
