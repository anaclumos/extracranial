> **Abstract Meaning Representation** (**AMR**) is a [semantic representation language](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_semantics_(linguistics)> 'Formal semantics (linguistics)'). AMR graphs are rooted, labeled, directed, acyclic graphs ([DAGs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph 'Directed acyclic graph')), comprising whole sentences. They are intended to abstract away from syntactic representations, in the sense that sentences which are similar in meaning should be assigned the same AMR, even if they are not identically worded. By nature, the AMR language is biased towards English â€“ it is not meant to function as an international auxiliary language.
