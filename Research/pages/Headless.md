In computer science, "headless" typically refers to software or hardware that operates without a graphical user interface (GUI) or display. This means that the software can run in the background without a visual interface and can be controlled and manipulated using command line interfaces (CLI), APIs, or other forms of remote access. For example, a headless browser is a web browser that can operate without a graphical user interface. It can be used for automated testing or web scraping, as it can access and interact with web pages just like a regular browser, but all interactions are performed programmatically. Similarly, a headless server or headless device operates without a screen, keyboard, or mouse and is usually managed remotely using a command-line interface or other tools.
