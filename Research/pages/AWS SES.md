AWS SES, or Amazon Simple Email Service, is a cloud-based email-sending service designed to help digital marketers and application developers send marketing, notification, and transactional emails. It is a reliable, cost-effective service for businesses of all sizes that use email to keep in contact with their customers.

AWS SES is part of the more extensive Amazon web Services (AWS) suite, which offers a broad set of global cloud-based product offerings, including computing, storage, databases, analytics, networking, mobile, developer tools, management tools, IoT, security, and enterprise applications.

Amazon SES integrates seamlessly with other AWS services, such as AWS IAM for access control, AWS S3 for email content storage, AWS CloudWatch for metrics and monitoring, AWS SNS for notifications, and AWS Lambda for running serverless code.
