- While with logical operators, it is possible to check if a value exists or not, if a block can be anywhere, we need to search everywhere.
- Where is the block we are looking for?
- Fully Associative Mapping
  - Any block from memory can be put in any cache block (i.e., no restriction)
  - $S=1$, $K=N$
  - Byte offset bits $b = \log_2B$ bits where $B$ is the block size
  - No set index because there is one set.
  - Most flexible (fewer evictions)
  - Longest search time $O(N)$
- Direct Mapping
  - Each block from memory can only be put in one location
  - $S=N$, $K=1$
  - Each set has one block.
  - Least flexible (more evictions)
  - Shortest search time $O(1)$
- K-Way Set-Associative Mapping
  - Given S sets, block $i$ of main memory maps to set $i\mod S$
  - Within the set, the block can be put anywhere.
  - Byte offset bits $b = \log_2B$ bits where $B$ is the block size
  - Set bits $s = \log_2S$ bits where $S$ is the number of cache sets
  - Tag bits $t$ = remaining bits
  - Compromised
    - 1-way set associative = Direct
    - N-way set associative = Fully Associative
  - Search Time is $O(K)$
  - For small $K$ Parallel Search with Hardware Optimization: $O(1)$
