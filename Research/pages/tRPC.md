[trpc/trpc: ðŸ§™â™€ Move Fast and Break Nothing. End-to-end typesafe APIs made easy.](https://github.com/trpc/trpc)

tRPC is a library that allows you to build and consume fully typesafe APIs without schemas or code generation. It is an [[alternative]] to traditional REST or [[GraphQL]], designed specifically for full-stack TypeScript developers. With tRPC, you can share types directly between your client and server without relying on code generation.

tRPC provides full static type safety and auto-completion on the client for inputs, outputs, and errors. It has zero dependencies and a small client-side footprint. The library is also framework agnostic, with adapters built for popular frameworks, and supports subscriptions and request batching.

RPC (Remote Procedure Call) is a way of calling functions on one computer (the server) from another computer (the client). tRPC allows you to call functions and receive responses without considering implementation details like [[HTTP]]/REST.

To start with RPC, you'll need to install the necessary packages and set up a [[Back-end|backend]] router. You can then define your [[API]] procedures (queries, mutations, and subscriptions) and serve the [[API]] using an adapter. Finally, you can use the RPC client to interact with the [[API]] on the client side, leveraging complete type safety and auto-completion.
