### [Why Do Protocols Win?](https://matt-rickard.com/why-do-protocols-win)

- From the 1970s to the 1990s, the goal of building a global computer network became more evident. However, how it would be made was one of the most fiercely debated topics in computer science
- Some refer to the 1970s-1990s as The Protocol Wars, a period where [competing standards](https://xkcd.com/927/) proliferated and competed for a foundational role in the internet. [TCP/IP vs. OSI](https://matt-rickard.com/layer-above-layer-below/), WWW vs. Gopher, and many more battles at every layer of the stack
- Working code is often better than a draft by a standards committee. See Clark's quote
- For example, Mosaic had a feature that automatically converted Gopher menus into HTML
- Simplicity
- Politics plays a more prominent role than technologists would like to admit. The U.S. Department of Defense was an early adopter of TCP/IP
- Meanwhile, the University of Minnesota charged licensing fees for Gopher servers
- Competing protocols often make different trade-offs, i.e., optimizing for computing or storage
