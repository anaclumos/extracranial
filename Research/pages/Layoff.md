### [What explains recent tech layoffs, and why should we be worried?](https://news.stanford.edu/2022/12/05/explains-recent-tech-layoffs-worried/)

- Why are so many tech companies laying people off right now
- If you look for reasons for why companies do layoffs, the reason is that everybody else is doing it. Layoffs [are the result of imitative behavior](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2580324?origin=crossref#metadata_info_tab_contents) and are not particularly evidence-based
- Do you think layoffs in tech are some indication of a tech bubble bursting or the company preparing for a recession
- Could there be a tech recession? Yes. Was there a bubble in valuations? Absolutely. Did [[Meta (Company)|Meta]] overhire? Probably. But is that why they are laying people off? Of course not. [[Meta (Company)|Meta]] has plenty of money. These companies are all making money. They are doing it because other companies are doing it
- What are some myths or misunderstandings about layoffs
- Layoffs often do not cut costs, as there are many instances of laid-off employees being hired back as contractors
- Layoffs often do not increase [[stock]] prices, in part because layoffs can signal that a company is having difficulty
- Layoffs do not increase productivity. Layoffs do not solve what is often the underlying problem, which is often an ineffective [[strategy]], a loss of market share, or too little revenue. Layoffs are basically a bad decision
- We ought to place a higher priority on human life

### [Tech Companies Are Irrational Pop Cultures](https://softwarecrisis.dev/letters/tech-is-a-pop-culture/)

- The symptoms of pop culture:
  - A "disdain for history" . Pop cultures believe history doesn't have anything to teach them.
  - Newer is automatically better. Pop cultures are built on the assumption that anything new or different is superior to established. Or in other words, older are inherently inferior.
  - What's next is going to be superior to what's now. Pop cultures exist in perpetual anticipation of the next trend. Their disbelief of history appears to outsiders as a belief in progress.
  - The "Pop" in "Pop Culture" stands for "popularity" . If it's popular, then it must be right
- These traits are deeply irrational, but they are the tech industry's default mode of operation
- A recent example of a pop culture trend taking tech by storm is layoffs
- The effect is even worse for software companies because [employee churn is lethal for software](https://www.baldurbjarnason.com/2022/theory-building/)
- The only way to win is to refrain from participating. Don't chase trends. Don't copy your competitors. Evaluate [[Strategy|strategies]], tools, and technologies on their own merits. Look at how they affect your organization, systems, products, and markets
- Don't let the industry's pop culture drag you into making poor decisions
