I always wanted to create a social group for my core audience, but Discord was too sassy...

[Matrix](https://matrix.org/) is an open-source protocol for secure, decentralized, real-time communication. It provides a flexible and versatile platform for various communication services, such as instant messaging, VoIP, and the Internet of Things (IoT). The Matrix.org Foundation, a nonprofit organization, maintains the project and its reference implementations. Matrix allows users to communicate with each other through decentralized servers called "home servers." These servers store and synchronize communication history and can be hosted by individuals, organizations, or third-party providers. Matrix uses end-to-end encryption to ensure secure communication and protects user data from unauthorized access. One of the significant advantages of Matrix is its ability to interoperate with other communication platforms, such as Slack, IRC, or even [[Mail|email]], through bridges. This means users on different platforms can communicate with each other seamlessly, making Matrix a highly flexible and adaptable communication solution. Users can use existing Matrix-based clients, such as [Element](https://element.io), to communicate securely with others on the network.
