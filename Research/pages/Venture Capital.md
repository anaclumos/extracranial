> Venture capital (often abbreviated as VC) is a form of private equity financing that is provided by venture capital firms or funds to startups, early-stage, and emerging companies that have been deemed to have high growth potential or which have demonstrated high growth (in terms of several employees, annual revenue, the scale of operations, etc.). Venture capital firms or funds invest in these early-stage companies in exchange for equity or an ownership stake. Venture capitalists take on the risk of financing risky start-ups in the hopes that some of the firms they support will become successful. Because startups face high uncertainty, VC investments have high rates of failure. The start-ups are usually based on an innovative technology or business model, generally from high-technology industries, such as information technology (IT), clean technology, or biotechnology.
