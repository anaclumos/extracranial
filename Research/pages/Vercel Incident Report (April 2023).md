I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve been very transparent about all of work happening around usage controls and pricing at Vercel. So I&#39;d like to do that now.<br/><br/>The tl;dr of the feedback is: more visibility into usage and more ways to control spending. And I think I haven&#39;t done a job good about…
