Product-market fit is the degree to which a product meets the needs of a particular market. In other words, it is the extent to which a product successfully satisfies a specific customer's needs and wants. Achieving product-market fit is often seen as an essential step for a new product or business to become successful. It's important to note that achieving product-market fit is not a one-time event but rather an ongoing process that a company must continuously work on to remain competitive and thriving in the market.
