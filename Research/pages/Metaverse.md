> In futurism and science fiction, the metaverse is a hypothetical iteration of the Internet as a single, universal and immersive virtual world that is facilitated by the use of [[virtual reality]] ([[Virtual Reality|VR]]) and [[augmented reality]] ([[Augmented Reality]]) headsets. In everyday use, a metaverse is a network of [[3D]] virtual worlds focused on social connection. [Metaverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaverse)

It has now come to my mind that Metaverse can be attained within years with [[Prompt Engineering]].
