> In futurism and science fiction, the metaverse is a hypothetical iteration of the internet as a single, universal, and immersive virtual world that is facilitated by the use of [[virtual reality]] ([[Virtual Reality|VR]]) and [[augmented reality]] ([[Augmented Reality]]) headsets. In everyday use, a metaverse is a network of [[3D]] virtual worlds focused on social connection. [Metaverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaverse)

Metaverse can be attained within years with [[Prompt Engineering]]. [Meta 3D Gen | Research - AI at Meta](https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/meta-3d-gen/)
