Life is a peculiar thing. We are born into a world we did not choose, and we exist for a brief period before we return to the void from which we came. Many of us spend our lives searching for meaning and purpose, hoping to make sense of this absurd existence we find ourselves in. But what if everything we do is ultimately pointless in the grand scheme of things?

Optimistic nihilism embraces the meaninglessness of existence while finding joy and purpose in the small moments that make life worth living. It acknowledges that life has no inherent meaning or purpose and that we are just specks in an infinite universe. But instead of feeling lost or hopeless, optimistic nihilists find freedom in this realization. They recognize that since nothing we do matters ultimately, **we are free to create meaning and purpose**. We can focus on the things that make us happy and fulfilled, even if they don't have any more considerable significance.

Similarly, the absurdity of existence is the idea that life has no inherent meaning or purpose and that the world is not entirely understandable by human reason. It is also the term used to describe the conflict or discrepancy between our natural desire for meaning and the apparent meaninglessness of the universe.

Of course, some people find comfort in the idea that life has a greater purpose and that their actions have meaning beyond their immediate impact. And that's okay; The beauty of optimistic nihilism is that it allows us to find meaning in life, whatever that may be. We can create our purpose and find joy in the things that matter to us.

Maybe, we spend too much time worrying about things we cannot control. Perhaps we should focus on the present moment and enjoy the small things that bring us happiness. We should be okay without making a lasting impact or leaving a legacy but focus on the things that matter to us in the here and now.
