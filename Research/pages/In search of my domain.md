Choosing domain names is always challenging.
It affects how people perceive, remember, or find you online.
That's why I wanted my domain name to be short and memorable.
I started looking for a domain name in 2018-ish when I decided to create an "online presence".
Some criteria in mind:
Relevancy to my name, catchiness, memorableness, length, etc.

I tried various combinations of my name, initials, and suffixes, but most were either taken or too expensive. But in the end, I was reassured that I should use either `sunghyun` or `cho` without any adjectives or nicknames.

I really did not want to use `.me` `.blog` or `.name` TLDs â€” it was okay, but something was off... `.com`s were too expensive, and `.net` felt like I chose it because the `.com` version was already registered. `.co.kr` or `.us` did not represent me correctly because I want to be geographically independent and free. `.org` was for domains and didn't match me. I liked `cho.pro` but couldn't register it somehow; `cho.co` was too expensive & felt too much like a joke, and `.xyz` felt like I ran out of ideas and picked the most available one. A year later, [[Google]] made the `.dev` domain [[GA]], and I also tried `cho.dev`, but â‘  the prices were too expensive (~$800), and â‘¡ I wanted to be more than a developer.

I later stumbled upon a domain name that caught my eye: `cho.sh`, especially given it contains all my name <u>S</u>ung<u>h</u>yun <u>Cho</u>. So I registered it in 2018 and experimented with GitHub Pages, but I did not want to use it at the moment for several reasons:

- The [[vocab]] **chosh** was registered as a negative meaning in Urban Dictionary, which I did not want to be associated with.
- I needed more technical proficiency to satisfy my vision for a personal website, which involved creating a custom theme, adding interactive features, and optimizing performance.
- I wanted to use the domain name finally when the tech was ready so that I could make a **ðŸ˜®**-ful impression

So I decided to postpone using `cho.sh` and instead used `blog.chosunghyun.com`, which was longer but more conventional and safe. I also continued to learn and improve my web development skills, hoping to one day launch my website with `cho.sh`.
In early 2022, I prepared to use `cho.sh` after figuring that the Urban Dictionary chosh term was deleted due to spam & wrongful information. Finally, I felt more confident and ready to showcase my work and thoughts online. I migrated my blog from WordPress to Ghost to [[Docusaurus]], making several contributions and almost **hacking** the framework along the way.

It is also worth mentioning what I mean by "tech is ready." I wanted to make a fully customizable [[digital garden]] & [[second brain]]. I laid out my vision before starting to work on the framework. Take a look: [Creating Next-gen Digital Brains ðŸ§  @ Sunghyun Cho](/w/D8FB8E)

Now, we all see I use the domain name `cho.sh`! I'm thrilled and proud of it.
I sometimes think of golfing it further, something less than four characters, but all seems unlikely. I guess `cho.sh` is the best domain name I could have chosen, and I don't plan to change it anytime soon. It's my online home, and you're always welcome here.
