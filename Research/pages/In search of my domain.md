Choosing a domain name is a challenging task. It can be a reflection of your identity, your brand, your personality, or your message. It can also affect how people perceive, remember, or find you online. That's why I wanted my domain name to be short and memorable.

I started looking for a domain name in 2018 when I decided to create a personal blog. I had some criteria in mind:

- It should be related to my name, Sunghyun Cho
- It should be catchy, catchy, catchy
- It should be easy to type, spell, and pronounce
- It should be available and affordable

I tried various combinations of my name, initials, and suffixes, but most were either taken or too expensive. Some examples include:

- procho.blog (used as a WordPress blog for a while)
- cho.pro (I wasn't able to register it)
- cho.dev (The price was too high, ~$800)

Then I stumbled upon a domain name that caught my eye: `cho.sh`. It was short, simple, and unique. It also had a nice ring to it, like a sound effect. I liked it so much that I registered it in 2018 and even experimented with GitHub Pages, but I did not want to use it at the moment for several reasons:

- The word **chosh** was registered as a negative meaning in Urban Dictionary, which I did not want to be associated with
- I did not have any technical proficiency to satisfy my vision for a personal website, which involved creating a custom theme, adding interactive features, and optimizing performance
- I wanted to use the domain name finally when the tech was ready so that I could make a good impression and avoid disappointing my visitors

So I decided to postpone using `cho.sh` and instead used blog.chosunghyun.com or any variation of it, which was longer but more conventional and safe. I also continued to learn and improve my web development skills, hoping to one day launch my website with `cho.sh`.

In early 2022, I prepared to use `cho.sh` after figuring that the Urban Dictionary chosh term was deleted due to spam & wrongful information. Finally, I felt more confident and ready to showcase my work and thoughts online. I migrated my blog from WordPress to Ghost to Docusaurus. I also designed and developed my theme, which is minimal, responsive, and dark mode friendly. I also added fantastic features, such as a custom search bar, a newsletter subscription form, and a comment system.

Now, we all see I use the domain name `cho.sh`! I'm thrilled and proud of it. It suits me well and represents me well. I hope you like it and find it easy to remember and visit. I hope you enjoy reading my blog posts and learning more about me and my interests.

I sometimes think of golfing it further, something less than four characters, but all seems unlikely. I guess `cho.sh` is the best domain name I could have chosen, and I don't plan to change it anytime soon. It's my online home, and you're always welcome here.
