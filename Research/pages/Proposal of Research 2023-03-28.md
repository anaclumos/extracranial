## Investigating Authority Systems to Mitigate [[Prompt Injection]] Attacks in [[Generative AI|Generative Text AI]] Models

### Abstract

Large Language Models ([[LLM|LLMs]]) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in answering [[natural language]] questions and adapting to new tasks through clever prompting. However, this adaptability might expose [[LLM|LLMs]] to security risks, such as [[Prompt Injection]] (PI) attacks. In this research proposal, we seek to investigate an authority system for [[LLM|LLMs]] to differentiate instructions from trusted sources and unknown figures. Furthermore, we aim to assess the feasibility of such an authority system and explore potential mitigation techniques to defend [[LLM|LLMs]] against PI attacks.

### Background

Recent studies have shown that [[LLM|LLMs]] can be susceptible to PI attacks, which prompted the model to produce malicious content or override the original instructions. These attacks are brutal to mitigate due to the [[LLM]]'s nature of following instructions. As [[LLM|LLMs]] are integrated into various applications and systems, including those with retrieval and API calling capabilities, new attack vectors arise, posing a threat to the security and privacy of users.

### Research Questions
