[[TODO]]: Convert this page into a more in-depth case study.

## My take

- If you don't know what you want, start from [Logseq](https://logseq.com/).
  - It's simple, fast, local, accessible, and open-source.
- If you know what you want, go with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).
  - It's highly customizable and free for local use.

If you have more specific needs, feel free to _roam_ the list below... I am keeping my eyes on Visual Thinking tools.

## One radical idea...

- Write everything as small chunks of notes (Posts.)
- Let web indexing do all of the interlinkings.
- You _search_ this custom search engine indices to pull up whatever you want to think "interlinkedly."
- Basically, give up linking things.
