애국심은 국가 단위의 스톡홀름 신드롬인가? 만약 아니라면, 그들은 어떻게 다른가? 예를 들어 마키아벨리는 군주론에서 다음과 같이 말했다.

> A powerful and courageous prince will overcome all such difficulties by giving at one time hope to his subjects that the evil will not be for long, at another time fear of the cruelty of the enemy, then preserving himself adroitly from those subjects who seem to him to be too bold.
>
> It is better to be feared than to be loved, if one cannot be both.
