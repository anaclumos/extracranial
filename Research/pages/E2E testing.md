End-to-end (E2E) testing is a methodology used to validate the flow of an application from start to end. It aims to test the software for dependencies, data integrity, and communication with other systems, interfaces, and databases, to confirm that all integrated components of an application are working efficiently. This testing methodology is called 'end-to-end' because it tests the application's workflow from its beginning to its end to ensure the system behaves as a user would expect.
