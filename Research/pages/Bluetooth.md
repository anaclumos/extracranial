Bluetooth is a wireless technology that allows devices to communicate with each other over short distances without the need for cables or wires. It uses radio frequency waves in the 2.4 GHz band to create a one-to-one connection between devices. Bluetooth devices can be up to 30 feet apart and will automatically reconnect if they move back within range.
