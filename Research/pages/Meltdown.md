Meltdown is one of the two original transient execution [[CPU]] vulnerabilities (the other being [[Spectre]]). Meltdown affects Intel x86 microprocessors, IBM POWER processors, and some [[ARM Architecture|ARM]]-based microprocessors. It allows a rogue process to read all memory, even when it is not authorized to do so. [Meltdown (security vulnerability)](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meltdown_(security_vulnerability)>)
