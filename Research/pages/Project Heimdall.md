> Heimdall's All-Seeing Eyes — Heimdall sees and hears all thanks to his extrasensory capabilities. His sight can extend across all Nine Realms and from the Bifrost Observatory, he can see 10 trillion souls. Asgardians call him from other worlds such as Earth, Jotunheim, and Sakaar.

## [[Prehistoric]]

Where would [[hn.cho.sh]] lead us? An [[AI]]-powered news portal? Reference: [[일일일]], [[News Minimalist]]

Would it eventually lead to a portal? Or should I remain as a newsletter? Would there be any other form?

## After some contemplation...

It should be `Airborne Early Warning` `Protoss's Observers` `Zerg's Overseer`, `Terran's Orbital Command`, `Super Long Range Radar`, `The Watchman`, `The Oracle's Eye`, `The ALL-SEER` that keeps you up to date on specific topics.

[[AI]]-powered news portal can never be the answer; it should be a platform where people can proactively seek and search foreign intelligence.

### Imagine a workflow...

In Karrot, scraping the news over the internet was a daily activity.

What if we can ask the `All-seer` to check for keywords `당근마켓` `캐롯` and `Karrot` every day?

### Themed Newsletters

What if we want to keep ourselves up to date on various topics but in a non-aggressive, [[Anti-Tiktok]] manner? Users can define:

- Hey Heimdall, give me daily reports on **Hacker News** (the current [[hn.cho.sh]] service)
- Hey Heimdall, give me daily reports on **TechCrunch**
- Hey Heimdall, give me daily reports on **대한민국 연예계 뉴스**
- Hey Heimdall, give me daily reports on **European Fashion Market**
