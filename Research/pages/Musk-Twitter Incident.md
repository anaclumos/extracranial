## [[Elon Musk]]

I wanted to reach out personally to share my motivation for acquiring [[Twitter]]. There has been much speculation about why I bought [[Twitter]] and what I think about advertising. Most of it has been wrong. I acquired [[Twitter]] because it is essential to the future of civilization to have a standard digital town square where a wide range of beliefs can be debated healthily without resorting to violence. There is currently great danger that social media will splinter into far right-wing and far left-wing echo chambers that generate more hate and divide our society. In the relentless pursuit of clicks, much of traditional media has fueled and catered to those polarized extremes, as they believe that is what brings in the money, but, in doing so, the opportunity for dialogue is lost.

That is why I bought [[Twitter]]. I didn't do it because it would be easy. I didn't do it to make more money. I did it to try to help humanity, whom I love. And I do so with humility, recognizing that failure in pursuing this goal, despite our best efforts, is a genuine possibility. That said, [[Twitter]] obviously cannot become a free-for-all hellscape where anything can be said with no consequences! In addition to adhering to the laws of the land, our platform must be warm and welcoming to all, where you can choose your desired experience according to your preferences, just as you can choose, for example, to watch movies or play video games ranging from all ages to mature.

I also believe that when done right, advertising can delight, entertain and inform you; it can show you a service, product, or medical treatment that you never knew existed but is suitable for you. For this to be true, it is essential to show [[Twitter]] users advertising that is as relevant as possible to their needs. Low-relevancy ads are spam, but highly relevant ads are content! Fundamentally, [[Twitter]] aspires to be the most respected advertising platform in the world that strengthens your brand and grows your enterprise. To everyone who has partnered with us, I thank you. Let us build something extraordinary together.
