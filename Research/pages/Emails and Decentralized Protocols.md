### [After self-hosting my email for twenty-three years, I have thrown in the towel. The oligopoly has won.](https://cfenollosa.com/blog/after-self-hosting-my-email-for-twenty-three-years-i-have-thrown-in-the-towel-the-oligopoly-has-won.html)

- [[Google]] has half a billion results for "[my email goes directly to spam](https://www.google.com/search?q=my+email+goes+directly+to+spam)
- [[Mail|email]] servers run bayesian filtering algorithms, which protect you, and most spam doesn't reach your inbox.
- Big Tech deliberately nerfs [[Mail|email]] deliverability.
- if you want to build services on top of the [[Mail|email]], you have to pay for an [[Mail|email]]-sending API which others in the industry have blessed. One of **them**.

- An excellent recommendation from the original discussion on [[Hacker News]] was to use [ImprovMX](https://improvmx.com) as an outgoing [[Mail|email]] server.
