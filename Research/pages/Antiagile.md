Many indiepreneurs and founders tout the importance of being antifragile Turning the tides, and distilling opportunity from danger.

I did quite the opposite. I turned a great opportunity into a lagging product.

In a way, I flipped some character sequences.

I WAS, ANTIFRAGILE

I WAS, ANTI AGILE FR

This is my story of how I left a great potential collecting dust for two years.

Back in 2023, when the GPT API was first released, I was one of the quick to create an agentic news notification system with GPT, first starting with Hacker News. I had a couple of reasonings and philosophies while building it.

- All Information Outlets encourage Doomscrolling. That's anti-humane. The relevant news should come to me and pitch themselves. One lousy example was Artifact. If something requires my effort to launch the app and doom scroll, that's a bad.
- The recommendation algorithm should be easy to understand, explicit and malleable by users. Tiktokifying all algorithm is taming independent thinkers.
- The engine should serve even outside of the Anglosphere equally. English is the Lingua Franca, but people will inherently move away if you enforce a specific way of acquiring new information. This leads to a gradient of information around the world. For example, my friends in Korea learned about GPT-4o Image Gen in Early April, whereas my US friends leared about it in Late March.
- OSS/ACC.
