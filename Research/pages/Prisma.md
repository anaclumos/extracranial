Prisma is an open-source [[database]] toolkit developed to make it easier to work with databases in modern applications.

1. Prisma Client: An auto-generated and type-safe query builder for Node.js & [[TypeScript]].
2. Prisma Migrate: A declarative data modeling & migration system.
3. Prisma Studio: A modern [[database]] IDE where you can view and edit data in your [[database]].
4. [[Prisma Accelerate]]

ORM stands for Object-Relational Mapping. This programming technique allows developers to manage a [[database]] like [[JavaScript]] objects, making interacting with the [[database]] easier.
