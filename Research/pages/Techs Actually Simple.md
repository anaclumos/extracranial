### [It's Just a Tarball](https://matt-rickard.ghost.io/its-just-a-tarball/)

- _Yet, container images are just tarballs_
- _Yet [[Git]]'s object model is pretty simple - content-addressed blobs (file-like), trees (folder-like), and commits that get stored in a `.git/objects` folder_
- _Some `[[git]]` commands are still just shell scripts under the hood_
- _Not to mention [plaintext protocols](https://matt-rickard.com/the-power-of-plaintext-protocols). [[HTTP]], [[SMTP]], FTP, and Redis Serialization Protocol (RESP) are a few examples_
- _Maybe one caveat is that nascent technology is often unnecessarily complex. Things are just getting pieced together - unoptimized workflows, artifacts leftover from failed experiments_
