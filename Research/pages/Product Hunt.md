## Scott's Advice

### What Went Well:

1. **Live Launch** — capitalized on the live audience at Troy DEMO, using QR codes to facilitate immediate upvotes.
2. **Active Promotion** — aggressively promoted your product across multiple social media platforms from the start to the end of the day.
3. **Engagement** — actively monitored and responded to comments on ProductHunt, even engaging with the platform's founder.
4. **Prepared Assets** — had all necessary promotional materials, like videos and banners, ready beforehand.

### Areas for Improvement:

1. **Audience Familiarity** — Many people who scanned the QR code weren't ProductHunt users, limiting the number of upvotes you could get.
2. **Timing** — The launch coincided with a busy academic period, reducing engagement.
3. **Presentation Glitch** — A mistake in the final slide of the pitch impacted your ranking and potential upvotes.
4. **Last-Minute Prep** — Preparation started too late, limiting your ability to build anticipation.
5. **Strategic Timing** — didn't consider the optimal time of the month for launching, missing out on potential accolades like Product of the Day or Month.
6. **Lack of Research** — didn't sufficiently study successful launches or understand how "hunters" on the platform behave.
7. **Competition** — The competitors launching on the same day can affect the ranking, something the team should have considered.
