Seoul, the capital of [[대한민국|Korea]], has a fascinating history behind its name. In the past, Seoul was used to refer to [[대한민국|Korea]]'s capital city. However, some people found using a common noun as a city name outright bad or improper. In 1955, the first [[대한민국|Korean]] President 이승만 suggested researching public opinion. A prominent [[대한민국|Korean]] linguist, 최현배, agreed and suggested [[alternative]] names like 한벌 (Han-Beol) or 삼벌 (Sam-Beol). However, the final candidates for the city's name were 우남(雩南, Woo-Nam, President's [[雅號|Ho]]), 한양(漢陽, Han-Yang), 한경(韓京, Han-Kyeong), and 한성(漢城, Han-Sung). The name **Seoul** eventually stuck. Today, Koreans use **Sudo** to refer to **Capital** instead. It is interesting to note that the terms of other capital cities, like Tokyo and Beijing, also have similar meanings in their respective languages.
