Bluesky is a decentralized social app that aims to replace Twitter. It was conceptualized by former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and developed in parallel with Twitter. Bluesky has a user interface similar to Twitter, with algorithmic choice, a federated design, and community-specific moderation. The app is built using an open-source framework called the [[AT Protocol]], which allows transparency and external contribution to its development. Initially, Dorsey intended for Twitter to adopt this decentralized standard, but since [[Elon Musk]] acquired the platform, Bluesky has become an independent company. Bluesky currently operates in a beta phase and is invite-only. It plans to be federated, meaning individual communities can exist within the open-source network.
