- [[Thought Experiment]]
- As noted on the [[Letter to Mr. Matt Rickard on 2022-12-24]], the conditions for a [[Super App]] in the [[United States of America|United States]] are vague. [[Apple]] and [[Google]] divide the tech market into two, not only in terms of [[iOS]] vs. Android but also as App [[Economy]] vs. Web [[Economy]], Closed vs. (fairly) Open, [[Edge]]-first [[AI]] vs. Cloud-first [[AI]], etc.
- [[Twitter]], [[Facebook]], [[Instagram]], and Snapchat cannot be super apps because they have specific fan groups and [[anti]]-fan groups. So the [[Super app]] needs to be universal.
- Universal, like a chat app. Chat app doesn't have a specific like-dislike. It's just a chat app.
- the [[super app]] must draw people, giving reasons to download and continue using them. Chat app if a critical mass onboard cannot stop. Especially with group chat, as we learned from [[Kakao]].

## Mental Simulation of Firefox and Signal as a Super App

- They must have a first instantly absorbable mass of users. The main target of Signal and [[Firefox]] are people who are flexible to switch platforms if they satisfy their specific needs, i.e., privacy in this case. They are also very tech-savvy and have plasticity.
- [[Super app]] needs technical talent, building a new platform, server techs, emulation techs, etc., as learned in [[Brane]] and [Web.dev Mini App Review](https://web.dev/mini-apps/). [[Firefox]] has this talent, as seen in the Gecko [[engine]].
- So, imagine someone acquiring both Signal and [[Firefox]] to build a universal chat app that can emulate and run small snippet programs.
- This may be the closest vision for a [[Super App]] in the Americas.
