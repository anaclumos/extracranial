## Science is not Technology and vice versa

- Technology was not developed based on science, nor was science studied for technical applications.
- Even before the principle of leverage was dynamically proven, the lever was used, and even before the iron-making technology was proved to be a chemical reduction reaction, the steel-making technology existed.
- Science and technology were formed in the 18th century, and until then, science and technology were separate.
- Technology has been passed on in apprenticeship classes without scientifically theorizing it.
- **Science ≠ Technology**.
  - But they both can help each other.

## The grand question

> Do you need a college degree in Software Engineering?

- As much as modern society evolved, the software needs to grow and mutate
- People always ask if you need a college degree for Software Engineerings
  - When you can find decent CS education on GitHub, Stack Overflow, and YouTube

## But a self-taught can code a dang fantastic [[React]] shopping mall!

- A self-taught dev can use [[React]] to make a cool-looking Single-Page-App [[JavaScript]] [[e-commerce]] website...
- But we must think,

> What makes [[React]] so coolly?

- [[React]]'s `Diff`ing Algorithm
  - Reduces $O(n^3)$ diffing operation to $O(n)$ **iff**
    1. Two elements of different types will produce other trees.
    2. The developer can hint at what elements will remain stable across renders with an essential prop. (This is why [[React]] always warns us to include keys in our props).
- Creating a diastrophic technology requires actual theory
- As much as developers in the industry can impact the world by improving page load time by 25%,
- People in the academic fields support those works.

> So, simply wrapping all developers as _Software Engineers_ is like categorizing all musicians as singers, including incredibly different types of musicians, from street-performing rappers to classical oboists, from [[대한민국|Korean]] idols to shamanist drummers.

## Conclusion

- It is about time to divide Software Engineers into two roles:
  - Computer Scientists: who actively research the fundamentals and theories
  - Computer Technologists: who actively apply existing theories to solve real-world problems
