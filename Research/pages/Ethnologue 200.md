The [Ethnologue 200](https://www.ethnologue.com/insights/ethnologue200/) is a list that accounts for most of the world's population, as it includes the top 200 languages spoken globally. Over 88% of people say one of these languages is their native tongue, and many hundreds of millions more speak them as second languages. This ranking takes into account both primary and secondary language speakers, showing the total usage worldwide.

The price of the complete list usually is [$249](https://store.ethnologue.com/e285c89e-b543-4fb6-9087-c3a76a6c988f), but [[Grammarly]] had a copy internally.
