- [[Computer Systems]]
- When the processor reads or writes, it will check if the cache contains the desired data.
- [[Principles of Locality]]
  - **Spacial Locality**. Entire blocks are transferred from the memory.
  - **Temporal Locality**. Leave data that is likely to be reaccessed. Least-recently-used blocks are evicted.
- Cache Miss: Umm, we cannot find what we want in the cache.
- Cache Hit: Yes, we found a copy of what we want in the cache!
