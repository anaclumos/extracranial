Computational linguistics combines linguistics, computer science, and artificial intelligence to develop algorithms, models, and systems that can process and analyze human language. It involves applying computational methods to language study, including developing [[Natural Language Processing]] ([[Natural Language Processing|NLP]]) technologies, machine translation, speech recognition, and text analysis.

The goal of computational linguistics is to enable machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language so that they can communicate with humans more effectively. This involves building systems that can recognize speech, translate text, extract meaning from written or spoken language, and even generate natural-sounding and grammatically correct language.

Computational linguistics is interdisciplinary, drawing on knowledge and techniques from linguistics, computer science, cognitive psychology, and mathematics. Its widespread applications include machine translation, sentiment analysis, question-answering systems, voice assistants, and chatbots, among many others.
