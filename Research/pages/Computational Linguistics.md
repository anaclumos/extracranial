Computational linguistics combines linguistics, [[computer science]], and [[AI|artificial intelligence]] to develop algorithms, models, and systems that can process and analyze human [[language]]. It involves applying computational methods to [[language]] study, including developing [[Natural Language Processing]] ([[Natural Language Processing|NLP]]) technologies, machine translation, speech recognition, and text analysis.

The goal of computational linguistics is to enable machines to understand, interpret, and generate human [[language]] so that they can communicate with humans more effectively. This involves building systems that can recognize speech, translate text, extract meaning from written or spoken [[language]], and even generate natural-sounding and grammatically correct [[language]].

Computational linguistics is interdisciplinary, drawing on knowledge and techniques from linguistics, [[computer science]], cognitive psychology, and mathematics. Its widespread applications include machine translation, sentiment analysis, question-answering systems, voice assistants, and chatbots, among many others.
