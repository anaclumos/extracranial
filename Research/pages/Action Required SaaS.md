## Newsletter

[[Someday]] [[Project]]. It's a [[Newsletter]] but you must

1. share the post once a week with someone else or with a community
2. or reply/comment to the author
3. or, just pay $0.9 per month (not aimed to generate money, it's for [[decoy effect]] â€” to encourage networking effects)

to keep subscribing to their content.

## SaaS

Need to invite one user to get 1 month of Pro usage. No other way (No paid solution)

Valuing growth > revenue

SaaS Ponzi? ğŸ˜‚
