1. [[Vertical Federated Learning]]
   - The goal is to train a model using data from multiple sites without sharing the raw data.
   - Each site may have different [[Feature|features]]/columns in their data, but some overlap.
   - The challenge is training parts of the network using the data available at each site.
1. Record Linkage
   - Matching records across sites to identify which records represent the same entity.
   - Can be done using properties like name, address, phone number, and string similarity.
1. Inference
   - Once the model is trained, inference is done globally using all available data for an entity, not just at one site.
1. Potential Conferences
   - NeurIPS in May 2024 is a good target conference. Earlier deadlines may be too soon.
1. Meeting Plans
   - Thursdays at 2 p.m. at ISI or remotely if needed.
