I am Sunghyun Cho, a B.S. student in computer science at [[University of Southern California|USC]], graduating on 05/2024. My primary interests are Computational Linguistics and organizing knowledge on the web. I keep my Knowledge Graph and Articles at https://cho.sh. I aspire to the new horizon of knowledge that Computer Science brings. However, I also despise the malicious use of that technology that preys upon human consciousness and infects human health. I also find myself addicted to digital media, knowing the very fact. I had difficulty consciously separating _I like software_ and _I like software by all means._ Think this way: The fascinating science behind nuclear physics and the wrath of atomic weapons are _separate_. Similarly, information technology and the decaying consciousness of digital addictions are irrelevant.
