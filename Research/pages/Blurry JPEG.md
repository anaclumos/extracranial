## [ChatGPT Is a Blurry JPEG of the Web](https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/chatgpt-is-a-blurry-jpeg-of-the-web).

> Think of [[ChatGPT]] as a blurry _jpeg_ of all the text on the Web. It retains much of the information on the Web, in the same way, that a _jpeg_ has much of the knowledge of a higher-resolution image, but if you're looking for an exact sequence of bits, you won't find it; all you will ever get is an approximation. But, because the approximation is presented in the form of grammatical text, which [[ChatGPT]] excels at creating, it's usually acceptable. So you're still looking at a blurry _jpeg_, but the blurriness occurs in a way that doesn't make the picture as a whole look less sharp.

- This article critically examines the capabilities and limitations of large language models like ChatGPT, comparing them to lossy text-compression algorithms.
- The model struggles with understanding fundamental principles and generating original content.
- Potential applications of these models in search engines, web content generation, and assisting original writing are explored, along with the challenges associated with their reliability, accuracy, and potential for misinformation.
- The importance of considering the benefits and limitations of large language models in future AI research and development is emphasized.
