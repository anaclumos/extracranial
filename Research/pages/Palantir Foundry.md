> NHS England used Palantir Foundry in dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic in England to analyze the operation of the vaccination program. A campaign was started against the company in June 2021 by Foxglove, a tech-justice nonprofit, because "Their background has generally been in contracts where people are harmed, not healed." Clive Lewis MP, supporting the campaign, said Palantir had an "appalling track record." [Palantir Technologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palantir_Technologies)
