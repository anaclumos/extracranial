Zenly, a popular Gen-Z location-sharing social app, shut down two days ago. So how did this French [[Small yet Powerful|hidden champion]] flourish and vanish? And what can we learn from it?

## Playbook

**Unparalleled technology**. The market has dozens of location-tracking apps that are either battery hoarders or inaccurate at best (not real-time or not precise.) Zenly shows surprising accuracy and battery efficiency from a 3-year research [[project]] for a child safety app before founding Zenly. Even from the early days, Zenly hired Ph.D.-level researchers to acquire unparalleled tech talents. Server and Front-end engineers were mainly seniors, forming a small elite team.

**Targeting the right group**. Zenly targeted Gen-Z's, finding that when a quarter of a school uses Zenly, it takes less than a week to saturate the entire school. Zenly focused on sub-group-led growths; for example, Japanese students studying abroad at Taiwanese University eventually spread Zenly to the whole island. One interesting note was that teenagers surprisingly did not care about privacy; the CEO regretted that privacy concerns in the early days were a waste of time—the market always outmove makers.

**Branding**. Location tracking is creepy, so they aimed the _Best Friend Forever_ or _In Real Life Friend_ vibe: pop interface, Gen-Z copywriting, cute colors, and smiley [[emoji]] everywhere. When asking for the actual location, it emphasized spending good times with your friends rather than the location tracking itself.

** Acquiring talents**. Zenly had not only exceptional engineers but also outstanding designers and operators. [[10x]] people don't join a startup upfront, so Zenly made them involved in the company by hiring them as a freelancer and then onboarded them to the team.

## Zenly, now part of history

From the Stay Home challenge in 2020 to a mass-scale [[3D]] map update in 2022, Zenly prepared for its upcoming future. However, the recent layoff at Snap wiped out the Zenly team alongside the Snap [[Mini App]] team. I do think this is Snap's mistake. Even my university peers do not use Snap anymore but still use Zenly. It almost feels like Facebook is killing Instagram for Facebook. I hope Zenly's revolutionary DNA gets well-integrated into Snap, seeking revival.
