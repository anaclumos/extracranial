[[Project]] Linguine is an initiative to define a deterministic list (i.e., the **_Linguine Recipe_**) to cover all linguistic [[Sprachraum]]. That is,

> How many people around the world do not speak any of the languages defined in Linguine?

... should be near zero.

Candidates are...

- BCP 47
- Ethnologue 200
- DeepL
- Google Translate

Supporting Ethnologue 200 is too much. Also, for BCP 47, it's not only unfair but also excessive to translate for en-US, en-CA, and en-GB separately. So we agree that a linguistic Sprachraum should be simplified, yet considering variants like Taiwanese (zh-TW is different from zh-CN)

Do we still need to support i18n? It's an extra bunch of costs, not going to lie. But technology is in an exceptional stage, where people from all regions are flying to silicon valley for a better life. People seek information worldwide, and considering those, backfilling the data would be relatively easy. It's laying out fisher rods worldwide, with just an extra cost.

After looking into the subscriber lists of [[hn.cho.sh]], I did notice that there are bogus subscriber lists. For example, I have no authentic Finnish subscribers. However, I want to keep the window open for international free minds to find the service. For example, I got an email from an Italian subscriber:

> I found the service thanks to the advertisement in your extension of Bing Chat for All Browsers. This service is very innovative, and I especially love the fact that it is in my language. I will certainly share this news with my friends who are tech enthusiasts. The first time I visited the site, I had the amazing feeling of being catapulted into the kind of future I've always dreamed of but never seen realized. Thank you for providing such a fantastic experience! Make the web truly innovative!

The most important thing is to keep the net service profit, or net neutral at least. At this burn rate, we cannot continue the service.

[[DeepL vs Google Translate vs Bing Translate Offering Comparison]]

So, in conclusion:

1. Use the following list.

2. For Curated Newsletters, you cannot sign up for more than three locales. This is to prevent bogus subscribers.
3. As such, we will have zero subscribers for Finnish, for example, because we have yet to have an actual customer. We will still translate the top 3 articles for advertisement and the 'magical landing experience.'
4. There can be a button to request translation. Maybe this can be a pro feature?

While comparing offerings, I found that `nb` and `no` are both used in the Norwegian Langauge. Interesting.
