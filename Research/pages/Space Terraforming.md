Space terraforming makes a planet or other celestial body more hospitable for life, typically through manipulating its environment. This could involve altering the planet's atmosphere, temperature, and other factors to create conditions suitable for human habitation.

The idea of space terraforming is often associated with science fiction, but it is also a topic of serious scientific inquiry. Some [[Researcher|researchers]] have proposed terraforming Mars, for example, by introducing greenhouse gases to warm the planet and create a thicker atmosphere, which would help to trap heat and melt the planet's ice caps. Other proposals include using mirrors or devices to [[redirect]] sunlight onto the planet's surface and create warmer conditions.

While space terraforming is an intriguing concept, it is also highly speculative and raises several ethical and practical questions. For example, some experts have raised concerns about the potential ecological impact of introducing Earth-based life forms to other planets. In contrast, others have questioned the feasibility and cost of terraforming projects. Nonetheless, the idea of space terraforming remains a subject of ongoing research and debate in the scientific community.
