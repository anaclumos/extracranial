> Jest is a JavaScript testing framework built on top of Jasmine and maintained by Meta (formerly Facebook). Christoph Nakazawa designed and made it with a focus on simplicity and support for large web applications. It works with projects using Babel, TypeScript, Node.js, [[React]], Angular, Vue.js, and Svelte. Jest doesn't require a lot of configuration for first-time users of a testing framework.
