- [[Mail|Letter]] to the [[Heptabase]] Team on [[2022-10-11]]

> On [[Heptabase]] and its Developer Ecosystem

Dear Mr. Chan,

很高興見到你! I am Sunghyun Cho, a computer scientist based in [[Los Angeles|LA]] and [[서울|Seoul]]. I am also a contributor to GoogleChrome/web.dev, [[Facebook]]/[[docusaurus]], [[Vercel]]/[[Satori]], Logseq/Logseq, Etc. I came across [[Heptabase]] and wanted to speak with you!

First of all, I want to show my support and love ❤ towards anyone contributing the rethinking the Extracranials (-- my terminology of external thinking support software)!

- Creating Next-gen Digital Brains https://cho.sh/w/D8FB8E

As you can see on my website, I am heavily obsessed with Digital Brains on the web. My entire research page (https://cho.sh/r/) runs on heavily customized [[Obsidian]], [[Nota]], and [[Docusaurus]], serving as my daily note-taking platform after figuring out [[Logseq]] Publish, [[Obsidian]] Publish, and Roam Garden did not suffice my needs.

I am recently experimenting with Visual Thinking tools (okso.app was an interesting one), and you would know that there aren't any open-source/open-data/developer-friendly services in the market yet. As much as I hope [[Heptabase]] becomes an Open Core model (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-core_model), it doesn't seem that's feasible shortly, considering there is still a [[Fiercely Overpriced|paywall]] upfront. However, I would love to explore [[Heptabase]]'s native APIs and endless possibilities 🚀

Now I would like to ask: Would there be some sort of... in the near future (within six months)?

- [[Markdown]]-Wikilink import/export
- [[API]] support ([[Notion]]-like?)
- Handwriting/Pen Support ([[iOS]] App)?
- Any open-source works
- Free-to-use Service
- [[WebExtension|Extension]] APIs

P.S. I love your work and blog and have always enjoyed reading your English/Taiwanese articles. I never knew Taiwanese → English translation evolved so well! Anyways, if you need any [[한국어|Korean]] 🇰🇷 translation support or anything I can help with, I'm more than happy to! I know a community of 900+ individuals interested in [[Heptabase]] & Visual Thinking.

感謝您, and I look forward to your response! 🇹🇼🇰🇷🇺🇸

敬祝 順利
