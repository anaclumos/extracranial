The limit of a function $f$ at $x_0$ is $L$ iff $\lim_\limits{x \to x_0} f(x) = L$ iff

$$
\forall \epsilon > 0, \exists \delta >0 : \forall x : 0 < |x - x_0| < \delta \to |f(x) - L| < \epsilon
$$

$f$ does not need to exist at $x_0$ to define the limit. However, for the function to be continuous, the $\lim_\limits{x \to x_0} f(x) = f(x_0)$.
