### [AWS is Not a Dumb Pipe](https://matt-rickard.com/aws-is-not-a-dumb-pipe)

- Telecom companies. became the "dumb pipe" by giving up higher-level services.
- Will [[AWS]] follow its track?
- Yes:
  - Being a dumb pipe is way more economical. Why waste money?
  - There are so many blooming industries. [[AWS]] can never catch up and will eventually become a pipe.
  - Private markets will foster _some_ higher-level service that downgrades [[AWS]] as one pipe of many, like Snowflake.
- No:
  - Product quality difference is very hard to notice these days. [[AWS]] has a huge business opportunity.
  - [[AWS]] can move up. Kafka → Kinesis. MongoDB → DocumentDB. Redis → MemoryDB. ElasticSearch → OpenSearch.
  - [[AWS]] engineers are already too tech-savvy. They will not miss a business opportunity.
  - Why would businesses add more vendors if they can use the [[AWS]] product?
  - Incentives are aligned between open source and hyperscalers (?)
