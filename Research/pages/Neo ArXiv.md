[[Someday]] [[Project]].

The new [[ArXiv]].

[[ArXiv]] is excellent, but it by no means matches the full-on productivity of modern DevOps. We need a more streamlined, so-called **ResearchOps**â€”a [[Super App]] platform for all research.

TeX sucks (or at least we need better [[interoperability]] with HyperText Media), and [[PDF]] sucks. Citing by their name sucks. It's like managing PRs by [[Mail|email]]. Remember Linus used to do that?

The current day [[ArXiv]] is like

- SourceForge, not [[GitHub]]
- Kaggle, not HuggingFace

And people only know what they want after seeing the future.

- What if we add interactive widgets in the middle of the papers?
- What if we add [[3D]] models right in the papers?
- Citations are automatically generated, similarly to how package.json works in npm install
- What if we can auto-translate to all locales? [[ACL 60-60]]
- and so on...

Why do they have so many typos?
