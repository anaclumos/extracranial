_what three words define me?_

Today I met an enginifounder who I had a lot of fruitful conversations. One key topic was what three words would define me. While I possess many different egos, I eventually concluded that I want to be a:

Free mind: I don't want to be defined as or limited by a ceiling where someone would say something is "impossible." I want to think big and develop creative breakthroughs so that no single problem is unsolvable. Indeed, as Linus said, "With enough eyes, all bugs/problems are shallow."

Accelerationist: While I don't fully agree with the Techno-optimist manifesto, I think it got the gist correct. I do admit that technological advancement is somewhat of a tumor in itself. It grows and matures uncontrollably, and human evolution has always suffered with decels. Their conclusion to this carcinogenic technological advancement is that a "social consensus" would magically stop human progress but also stop the side effects. I don't think so. I believe the side effects of technological advancements are controlled by more advanced tech only. That's the nature of greed—and I call this approach Desire-Compatible Growth & Preservation. This applies to e/acc, nuc/acc, bio/acc, med/acc…

Superbrain: We've seen enough asshole CEOs that nowadays, being an asshole is a virtue for a CEO. I don't think that way. As noted in my essay on Mr. Rauch, I am more of Lisa Su than Steve Jobs. I want to be someone who actually can do it themselves but doesn't have the time and energy that they have no choice other than to hire more people and expand the business.
