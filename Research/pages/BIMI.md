> BIMI is designed to ensure that logos are displayed only for messages that properly originate from a sending organization. BIMI leverages a domain's deployment of [DMARC](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7489) (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance) to prevent domain impersonation. It works with VMCs ([[Checkmark|Verified Mark]] Certificates) and other forms of BIMI Evidence Documents to verify the ownership and authenticity of a logo and the logo's connection to that domain.
