Short essay on [[2023-07-05]]:

**Impact over Performance** is a philosophy. While we rage on the _latest and greatest_ tech stack, tech is never the product. For example:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

[Original Post Link](https://t.co/jZn6eesb2K) is now almost 14,000 lines of raw PHP mixed with inline HTML, CSS in &lt;style&gt; and raw JS in &lt;script&gt; tags

I did not use TS, flexbox or frameworks except jQuery

A lot of \$.ajax() and float:left though

It has 1,872 paying customers making \$61,808 per month

[[Pieter Levels]] generates millions of revenue every month but with [[jQuery]]. Who cares about the tech stack if they can make a good product? But I am too much of a technophile [[aesthete]]... so I have devised the [[IDOL Stack]]. Remember, use [[Boring Technologies]].

- Use [[boring technologies]]
- [[Bootstrap]]
- Deliver day 1
- Sharable architectures: [[IDOL Stack]]
- [[Antipreneur]]
- [[Supergravity Products]]
