> Write once, run anywhere (WORA), or sometimes Write once, run everywhere (WORE), was a 1995 slogan created by Sun Microsystems to illustrate the cross-platform benefits of the [[Java]] language. Ideally, a [[Java]] program could be developed on any device, compiled into standard bytecode, and be expected to run on any device equipped with a [[Java]] virtual machine (JVM). Installing a JVM or [[Java]] interpreter on chips, apparatus, or software packages became an industry standard practice.
