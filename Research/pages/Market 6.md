Gave me chills since the first day of looking at this. I still think this is the GOAT of user field interactions [[UI and UX|UI]]

I dissected it with [jhaemin (Jang Haemin)](https://github.com/jhaemin) and figured it's dynamically adding JS classes with height transition animations. The "error messages" are clipped and hidden underneath. When there is an error, JS adds a class that makes the element higher, thus revealing the message. Paired with bunch of CSS transform animations.
