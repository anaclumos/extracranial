> glTF (derivative short form of [[Graphics]] Language Transmission Format or GL Transmission Format) is a standard file format for three-dimensional scenes and models. A glTF file uses one of two possible file extensions: .gltf ([[JSON]]/ASCII) or .glb (binary). Both .gltf and .glb files may reference external binary and texture resources. Alternatively, both formats may be self-contained by directly embedding binary data buffers (as base64-encoded strings in .gltf files or as raw byte arrays in .glb files). An open standard developed and maintained by the Khronos Group; it supports [[3D]] model geometry, appearance, scene graph hierarchy, and [[animation]]. It is intended to be a streamlined, interoperable format for delivering [[3D]] assets while minimizing apps' file size and runtime processing. Its creators have described it as the "JPEG of [[3D]]."
