Anyone can do this (took me 8h in total) 1. I saw a hot topic 2. I checked google search volume 3. Found high-traffic keyword 4. Bought a domain on godaddy 5. Built a directory 6. Got SEO traffic 7. Made !ðŸ’° on sponsors, ads, and referrals ! 1. Idea. Go to google keyword planner and search for ideas.

I saw hype around nextjs boilerplates, so I searched for this term and found low-competition keywords with good traffic. 2. Then I went to godaddy to search for a domain. I always start with .com, since after all my tests, .com beats crap out of everything else. So I bought nextjsstarter dot com. 3. I built a directory on it using [@unicornplatform](https://twitter.com/unicornplatform) just out of the template in less than an hour. I made a logo using chatgpt Dalle. I went on Google Keyword Planner to grab top 10 keywords and placed them on a home page. I used this template -> [â€¦https://best-startups-dark.unicornplatform.page](https://t.co/wvGfqEEPM2)

4. I scraped all dev tools from Product Hunt and DevHunt and found all boilerplates there. I also searched on hacker news, devto, github, google and X. I found about 50 items and got 100 more submitted via the from later by the authors. 5. I turned on [@seobotai](https://twitter.com/seobotai) to generate 100 blog articles. The articles turned out to be really good, I even learned a few things while reading them.

6. I turned on IndexRusher to get all my pages indexed. I had 250 pages in total. For a new domain it takes months to get the indexed or even more. 7. Things started to grow. Day after day.

I didn't publish the blog right away. I launched the site and let it warm up for 2 months and launched the blog on third month. 8. Monetization. While having pretty decent SEO traffic and also click-traffic (got few viral posts and blogs) the site became attractive for nextjs boilerplate authors, so I made good revenues on selling "featured-spot". 9. Next steps. - more blog articles around nextjs "how-tos" - programmatic SEO (got a crazy cool idea on what to do) - run [https://listingbott.com](https://t.co/Tjcu3Jqgb8) to grow Domain Rating by getting 100 more backlinks to multiple existing traffic. Whenever I tried launched many pages at once, I failed at growing the site. 10. That's it.
