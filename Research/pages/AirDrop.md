AirDrop is a feature in [[iOS]] and [[macOS]] that lets you wirelessly share files between nearby [[Apple]] devices. AirDrop uses [[Bluetooth]] low energy to discover and negotiate connections and point-to-point Wi-Fi to transfer information. You can use AirDrop to share photos, videos, websites, and locations between devices that are up to about 30 feet apart. AirDrop was introduced in Mac [[macOS|OS X]] Lion ([[macOS|Mac OS X]] 10.7) and [[iOS]] 7. It requires [[iOS]] 7, [[iOS|iPadOS]] 13, or [[macOS|OS X]] 10.10, or later. Both Wi-Fi and [[Bluetooth]] must be turned on to use AirDrop. AirDrop is generally considered secure as long as users take precautions such as setting it to "Contacts Only" or "Receiving Off." [[Apple]] has implemented several security features to ensure that data transfers are private and secure.
