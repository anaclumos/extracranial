[[Someday]] [[Project]]. Creating a "[Quoridor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quoridor)" game and its corresponding [[AI]] system.

A basic minimax algorithm seems sufficient.
There are some examples to take notes from:

- Massagué Respall, Victor & Brown, Joseph & Aslam, Hamna. (2018). Monte Carlo Tree Search for Quoridor. This paper presents a preliminary study using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) upon the board game of Quoridor. Quoridor is an interesting game for expansion of player agents in MCTS due to having a mechanically simple rule set, however, Quoridor has a state-space complexity similar to Chess with a higher game-tree complexity. The system is shown to perform well against current existing methods, defeating a set of player agents drawn from an existing digital implementation as well as a previous method using a GA.
