The word **[[Unicorn]] Company** gives the company too much of a _magical_ sentiment as if it was _destined_ to be successful. Maybe it should be Carp 🐟 → Imoogi 🐍 → Dragon 🐉 company, as in Korean folklore.

As a fish, you take tons of effort and time to train yourself to become a semi-dragon Imoogi 🐍, and only a few select Imoogi 🐍 (few fortunate ones) gets bequeathed a Yeouiju, the magical gem 🔮, to become the godly dragon.

It more precisely describes the nature of the industry, not only because of the long training process but also because of your possession of Yeouiju 🔮 is not forever. Sometimes a stronger Imoogi 🐍 takes from you, but more often, you make a mistake and lose the Yeouiju 🔮 yourself.
