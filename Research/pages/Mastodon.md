- [[The Architecture of Mastodon]]

> Mastodon is a **free, open-source social network server** based on [[ActivityPub]] where users can follow friends and discover new ones. On Mastodon, users can publish anything they want: links, pictures, text, video. All Mastodon servers are interoperable as a federated network (users on one server can seamlessly communicate with users from another one, including non-Mastodon software that implements [[ActivityPub]])! [mastodon/mastodon: Your self-hosted, globally interconnected microblogging community](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon)

> Mastodon is free and open-source software for running self-hosted social networking services. It has microblogging features similar to the Twitter service, which are offered by a large number of independently run Mastodon nodes (technically known as instances), each with its own code of conduct, terms of service, privacy options, and moderation policies. [Mastodon (software)](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastodon_(software)>)

> Every Mastodon explanation is like "It's very simple, your account is part of a kerflunk, and each kerflunk can talk to each other as part of a bumblurt. At the moment everyone you flurgle can see your bloops but only people IN your kerflunk can quark your nerps. Kinda like email." https://mas.to/@Ciaraioch@mastodon.ie/109287825141624121
