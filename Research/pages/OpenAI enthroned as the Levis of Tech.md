# OpenAI enthroned as the Levi's of Tech

[[OpenAI]] has launched its [[ChatGPT]] API service, powered by the GPT-3.5-turbo [[AI]] model. The model is available for $0.002 per 1,000 tokens and can be used for non-chat applications. Early adopters of the [[ChatGPT]] API include Shopify, Instacart, Quizlet, and Snap. This is another cornerstone moment for software. **The [[AI-native]]-era gold rush has just begun**.

Levi's was always the actual winner of the gold rush, making a fortune by supplying miners with the tools they needed to extract gold while never involving in the actual competition. They were the arms dealer in this silent war. [[AWS]] was the latest Levi's of the tech industry, after the comms companies like AT&T. Just as the gold rush created a massive demand for supplies like jeans and hammers, the digital transformation has made an enormous demand for cloud computing services like [[AWS]]. [[OpenAI]] just officialized that they will be the next Levi's. By providing businesses with an easy way to integrate [[AI]] models into their products and services, [[OpenAI]] is positioning itself to be a significant player in the emerging [[AI-native]] era.

## The rise of [[AI-native]]s

It is also worth observing how the previous Levi's, [[AWS]], reformed the tech environment; the advent of cloud computing has transformed how we approach software engineering. Some tectonic shifts:

- **Fewer expensive On-Premise Engineers**. Gone are the days we needed on-premise system engineers configuring servers and managing infrastructure. We deploy applications without worrying about managing the underlying hardware.
- **Shift from Pets to Cattle**. In the early days of computing, companies treated their servers like pets – they gave each one a unique name and invested time and resources individually. But as the number of servers and resources grew, companies began treating their servers and resources like cattle – they invested in [[automation]] tools that allowed them to manage large numbers of resources. This shift enabled companies to scale up their infrastructure rapidly without sacrificing reliability or performance.
- **Rise of [[Microservices Architecture|MSA]] and [[Serverless]]**. [[AWS]] made it easy to spin up and manage small, independent services, leading to the emergence of [[microservices architecture]]. This architecture enables developers to build complex applications using small, modular services, improving reliability and performance. Even further, [[AWS]] Lambda, introduced in 2014, enabled developers to build and run applications without managing servers.

So what will happen now with [[AI-native]]s?

- **Fewer expensive Data Engineers & [[ML]] Engineers**. The rise of [[AI-native]] platforms makes it easier for non-experts to build and deploy [[AI]] models and reduces the need for dedicated [[AI]] engineers in many cases.
- **Shift from building models from scratch to using pre-built models:** Just as [[AWS]] provides pre-built infrastructure components, [[AI-native]] platforms provide pre-built [[ML|machine learning]] models that can be customized and trained using your data.
- **Rise of [[automation]] tools for building and deploying [[AI]] models:** Just as [[automation]] tools have enabled companies to manage large numbers of servers and resources in the cloud, [[AI-native]] platforms are allowing companies to [[Automation|automate]] the building process and deploy [[AI]] models.
- **Shift from monolithic [[AI]] applications to [[Microservices Architecture|microservices]]-based [[AI]] architectures:** As [[microservices architecture]] has enabled companies to build complex applications using small, modular services, [[Microservices Architecture|microservices]]-based [[AI]] architectures are allowing the companies to build complex [[AI]] applications using small, modular [[AI]] models.
- **Democratization of [[AI]] development and deployment:** As [[AWS]] democratized cloud computing, [[AI-native]] platforms democratize [[AI]] development and deployment.

One outstanding question remains: [will OpenAI become another dumb pipe](https://matt-rickard.com/aws-is-not-a-dumb-pipe)?
