> Naver (Hangul: 네이버) is a South Korean online platform operated by the Naver Corporation. It debuted in 1999 as the first web portal in [[대한민국|Korea]] to develop and use its search [[engine]]. It was also the world's first operator to introduce the comprehensive search feature, which compiles search results from various categories and presents them on a single page. Naver has since added many new services ranging from basic features such as e-mail and news to the world's first online Q&A platform, Knowledge iN. [Naver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naver)
