# Everynews

Google Alerts worked great for passive web monitoring but had limitations.

- **Too literal**. If you want to monitor news on the SWIFT banking system, well, good luck.
- **No context understanding**. What if you want to monitor *new models*, as in actual new fashion models?
- **Limited delivery options**. Wouldn't it be great to send it to a Slack channel?

Everynews will try to fix the above problems.

- **Semanticity**
  - LLMs and Vector Storage
  - Context-aware matchings beyond literal terms
  - Better domain-specific understandings
- **Granular delivery settings**
  - Time-based batching (send at 8 a.m. Seoul time)
  - Volume-based batching (wait for 10 items)
  - Multiple delivery channels (email, Slack, etc.)
  - Custom templates, APIs, webhook integration, and more to come
- **Feedback systems**
  - Reply to an alert explaining why it's not relevant
  - Everynews will keep that feedback in mind when composing the following alert

Who'd use it?

- **Professionals** tracking personal brand monitoring, industry trends, etc
- **Research teams** follow academic papers, monitor patents, etc
- **Business teams** monitoring the market, competitor, brand sentiment, etc
- **PR and Communications** assessing brand mentions, campaign performance, media coverage, etc
