The Cauchy [[distribution]] is a continuous [[probability]] [[distribution]] named after the French mathematician Augustin Cauchy. It is also known as the Lorentzian [[distribution]]. It is characterized by its "thick-tailed" shape, meaning that it has a more significant proportion of data points in the tails of the [[distribution]] than other common distributions like the normal [[distribution]].

The Cauchy [[distribution]] has a [[PDF]] ([[probability]] density function) given by:

$$
f(x) = \frac{1}{\pi}\cdot \frac{d}{d^2 + (x - m)^2} = \frac{1}{\pi d (1 + (\frac{x-m}{d})^2)}
$$

where $m$ is the location parameter and $d$ is the scale parameter. The Cauchy [[distribution]] has no mean or [[variance]], as the [[moments]] do not exist for this [[distribution]]. The Cauchy [[distribution]] is used in various fields, such as physics, [[finance]], and [[statistics]], as it is often used to model phenomena with "thick-tailed" behavior or outliers. It is also used as a test case for various statistical methods, as its heavy tails make it more challenging to estimate statistical parameters accurately.
