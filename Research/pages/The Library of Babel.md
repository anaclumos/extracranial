- [[Mathematics under The Library of Babel]]

> The Library of Babel is a short story by Argentine author and librarian Jorge Luis Borges (1899–1986); conceiving of a universe in the form of a vast library containing all possible 410-page books of a specific format and character set. The story was initially published in Spanish in Borges' 1941 collection of stories, The Garden of Forking Paths. That entire book was, in turn, included within his much-reprinted Ficciones (1944). Two English-language translations appeared approximately simultaneously in 1962, one by James E. Irby in a diverse collection of Borges's works titled Labyrinths and the other by Anthony Kerrigan as part of a collaborative translation of the entirety of Ficciones.

If multiple monkeys make random keystrokes for a couple of eternities,
they would create all of the internets.
