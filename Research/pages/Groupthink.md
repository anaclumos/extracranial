Groupthink in a startup context refers to the phenomenon where team members prioritize consensus and harmony over critical thinking and independent decision-making. This leads to a lack of diverse opinions, stifling creativity and potentially resulting in poor strategic choices. It can be detrimental to a startup's success, as innovation and adaptability are often critical factors for growth and survival in competitive markets.

> "Because if you work with somebody else in a team, there's a big tendency of groupthink, where everyone starts hyping each other on the idea's value. The prototype might only get mild validation from paying users, but you're working with this group and already so crazy about it that it doesn't matter what users pay/do/say. That's very bad. It should only be about the users." â€” [MAKE: The Indie Maker Handbook](https://readmake.com/)
