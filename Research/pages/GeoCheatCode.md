- If I'm mapping 90,000 things, I'm not going to quality-check each of those 90,000 things
- Sometimes, things among the 90,000 things are kind of nuts (misspelled, inclusive of extraneous data, oddly formatted
- I noticed that when I manually typed things into the [[Google]] Maps search bar, it forgave a myriad of sins and did a great job centering the map on its best guess
- Because [[Google]] is many things good and evil, but of these, one is certain: [[Google]] is good at search
