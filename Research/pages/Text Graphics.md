> ASCII art is a graphic design technique that uses computers for presentation and consists of pictures pieced together from the 95 printable (from a total of 128) characters defined by the ASCII Standard from 1963 and ASCII-compliant character sets with proprietary extended characters (beyond the 128 characters of standard 7-bit ASCII). The term is also loosely used to refer to text-based visual art in general. ASCII art can be created with any text editor and is often used with free-form languages. Most examples of ASCII art require a fixed-width [[font]] (non-proportional fonts, as on a traditional typewriter) such as Courier for presentation.
