> Iterative and incremental development is any combination of both iterative design or iterative method and total build model for development. Usage of the term began in software development, with a long-standing variety of the terms iterative and incremental being widely suggested for considerable development efforts. For example, the 1985 DOD-STD-2167 mentions (in section 4.1.2): "During software development, more than one iteration of the software development cycle may be in progress at the same time." and "This process may be described as an 'evolutionary acquisition' or 'incremental build' approach." The overall software development process determines the relationship between iterations and increments.
