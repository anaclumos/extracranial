## [[Andy Matuschak]]

- It's hard to write notes that are worth developing over time. These principles help:

1. [Evergreen notes should be atomic](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4Rrmh17vMBbauEGnFPTZSK3UmdsGExLRfZz1)
1. [Evergreen notes should be concept-oriented](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z6bci25mVUBNFdVWSrQNKr6u7AZ1jFzfTVbMF)
1. [Evergreen notes should be densely linked](https://notes.andymatuschak.org//z2HUE4ABbQjUNjrNemvkTCsLa1LPDRuwh1tXC)
1. [Prefer associative ontologies to hierarchical taxonomies](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z29hLZHiVt7W2uss2uMpSZquAX5T6vaeSF6Cy)
1. [Write notes for yourself by default, disregarding the audience](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z8AfCaQJdp852orumhXPxHb3r278FHA9xZN8J)
