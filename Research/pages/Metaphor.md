"meta," meaning "over, across," and "phor," derived from "pherein," which means "to carry" or "to bear."

A metaphor is a figure of speech in which a word or phrase is applied to an object or action to which it is not literally applicable. It is a way of comparing two things by saying that one thing is another thing, often used to make a description more vivid or understandable.
