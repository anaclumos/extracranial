## Division

```swift
let weeks = 465 / 7
print("There are \(weeks) weeks until the event.")
// 66
```

```swift
let weeks: Double = 465 / 7
print("There are \(weeks) weeks until the event.")
// 66.42857142857143
```

```
let weeks = 465 / 7
let days = 465 % 7
print("There are \(weeks) weeks and \(days) days until the event.")
```

## While

```swift
while (condition){
  // body of loop
}
```

```swift
repeat {
  // body of loop
} while (condition)
```

Same as do-while loop
