macOS is a proprietary, graphical operating system ([[OS]]) that powers [[Apple]]'s Mac computers. It's the primary [[OS]] for [[Apple]]'s Mac computers. macOS comes preloaded on all new [[Apple]] Macintosh computers. It's the second most widely used desktop [[OS]], after [[Microsoft]] Windows and ahead of [[Linux]]. macOS was the first mainstream [[OS]] to feature a graphical user interface and mouse input. The macOS desktop interface is called the Finder. It was introduced in 2001 as the successor to the classic Mac [[OS]]. The first desktop version, Mac [[OS]] X 10.0, was released in March 2001. macOS is designed specifically for the hardware it runs on. It lets you do things you can't with other computers. It comes with a suite of beautifully designed apps.
