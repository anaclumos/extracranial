JVM stands for Java Virtual Machine. It's a virtual machine or runtime environment that allows [[Java]] programs to run on multiple devices and operating systems. The JVM interprets [[Java]] bytecode to run as a program, providing a runtime environment to execute this process. It's an integral part of the [[Java]] Runtime Environment (JRE).

The JVM is separate from its operating environment, supporting the "write once, run anywhere" philosophy. It enables a computer to run [[Java]] programs as well as programs written in other languages that are also compiled into [[Java]] bytecode.

The JVM translates bytecode into native machine code, which is a set of instructions that a computer's [[CPU]] executes directly.
