> Svelte is a free and open-source [[Front-end|front-end]] compiler created by Rich Harris and maintained by the Svelte core team members. Svelte is not a monolithic JavaScript library imported by applications: instead, Svelte compiles [[HTML]] templates to specialized code that manipulates the [[DOM]] directly, which may reduce the size of transferred files and give better client performance; application code is also processed by the compiler, inserting calls to automatically recompute data and re-render UI elements when the data they depend on is modified. This also avoids the overhead associated with intermediate runtime representations, such as virtual [[DOM]], unlike traditional frameworks (such as [[React]] and Vue), which carry out the bulk of their work at runtime, i.e., in the browser. The compiler itself is written in [[TypeScript]]. Its source code is licensed under MIT License and hosted on [[GitHub]]. [Svelte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svelte)
