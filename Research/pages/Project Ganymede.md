Used Prisma, Prisma Accelerate, PlanetScale, and Cloudflare Workers to create a simple server for the [[Ganymede Table Structure]]. Prisma layer makes 3 requests to the DB per 1 request to the server, albeit it probably would hit the Prisma Accelerate Layer, we can later optimize it with [this document.](https://planetscale.com/blog/integrate-cloudflare-workers-with-planetscale)

- [[PhotoPicker]]
- Finished reading the Apple Sign-In UUID from the iMessage Extension side: had to use App Groups and UserDefaults

- It is **possible** to limit iMessage forwarding for iMessage Extensions
- It is **possible** to mark the iMessage with `LocalParticipantIdentifier`
- `LocalParticipantIdentifier` is different on all devices
- The simplest way would be marking:
  - Set `LocalParticipantIdentifier` to `true` on reading (on the server)
  - Reject if `LocalParticipantIdentifier` is already `true`
- Problem: If the user deletes and reinstalls the app, `LocalParticipantIdentifier` changes. So the user can read unlimited times if the uninstall & reinstall
- Mitigation: Assign UUID for each message. Each message will have `LocalParticipantIdentifier + RemoteParticipantIdentifiers` count as the `maxRead`. This will at least 'limit' the max read count.
- Problem: on a Group Chat setting, a user can read unlimited times instead of another participant.
- Solution: Sign in with Apple?!

I figured out that in iOS 17, Shortcuts can send messages without confirmation. Can we use this for [[Send Separately]] or Ganymede?

- Read notifications
- Screenshot notifications
- Broadcast
- App Clip + Apple Login?
- Therefore, we name it Project Ganymede. You can NEVER win Apple. It is the most massive system, just like Jupiter. Therefore, we choose to become a moon. The moon of Jupiter. And a moon can be bigger than planets. Ganymede is bigger than Mercury.

I finished some working prototypes. Some concerns: It seems like the transcript `MSMessage` is an immutable object. We might consider server approaches, such as KV storage.

![[B89B94.gif]]

I don't want to store any encrypted or decrypted messages on the server. So we can consider something as:

- When sending a message
  - encrypt message
  - generate UUID
  - write to KV storage as `UUID` â†’ `DecryptKey`
  - send UUID and encrypted message to iMessage
- When reading the message
  - extract UUID and encrypted message
  - read KV with UUID and delete the `DecryptKey` if any necessary condition is met
  - once it expired, the user cannot read the message again

### Considerations

- How do you store different strategies (After 5 seconds? 10 seconds? 15 seconds?)
- Group chats
- Photo / Video Payload
- Screenshot detections and notifications

## [[Prehistoric]]

- [[Project]]. Disappearing message for [[iMessage]].
- every message self-destructs in 10 seconds
