Adobe After Effects is a software application that allows users to create motion [[graphics]] and special effects for videos, online content, and presentations. It's used in the post-production process for film, television, and video game production. After Effects can be used for keying, tracking, compositing, and [[animation]]. After Effects is available on both [[macOS|Mac OS]] and Windows computers. Users can download a 7-day free trial of After Effects. Some say that After Effects can be challenging to learn, especially for beginners. Users should have a working knowledge of [[linear]] video, [[3D]] [[animation]], and special effects before creating projects in After Effects.
