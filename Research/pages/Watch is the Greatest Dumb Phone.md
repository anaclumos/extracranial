Essay on [[2023-07-25]].

I've been thinking for a while about getting a [[Dumb Phone]] in the context of [[Dopamine Detox]]. While most of the dumb phones are great, the problem was that I couldn't switch devices back and forth easily. Plus, sometimes, I would need help from modern apps, which rendered it impossible on these devices.

Then, I had an epiphany. Apple Watch is the prime dumb phone! It does all the things I wanted to do — not being able to scroll infinite media, not watching YouTube (technically, you can watch YouTube on watches, but if you do, you seriously have a problem :p), not wasting time browsing meaningless websites... It also gives me benefits like Apple Pay and navigation. This was perfect!
