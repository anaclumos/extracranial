Server-side rendering (SSR) is a technique used in web development where web pages are generated on the server and sent to the client's [[Web Browser|browser]] as complete [[HTML]] documents. In SSR, the server processes the requested page and dynamically generates the [[HTML]] content, considering any data or logic required to render the page.
