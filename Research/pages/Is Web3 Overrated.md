When it sidesteps regulations on early-stage investing through token offerings and convinces ordinary people that their only way to financial stability is to bet their savings on technologies that they don’t understand because “this is the future
- So far, the primary successes of web3 have been in shiny marketing, selling people the opportunity to invest in vaporware
- There will be a web3. The web has been evolving ever since its inception, and there is no doubt in my mind that we are overdue for a fundamental shift. Will it be blockchains and crypto? Venture capitalists and blockchain startup founders hope that you think so
- But when presented with lofty promises, we must remember distinguishing steam-powered computers from genuinely revolutionary ones.
- Dig deep. Ask the hard questions. Criticize the flaws. And cut through the bullshit
