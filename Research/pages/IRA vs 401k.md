1. Traditional IRA:
   - Pre-[[tax]] Contributions: The money you put into a Traditional IRA is typically [[tax]]-deductible in the year of the contribution.
   - [[Tax|Taxes]] on Withdrawals: The money you withdraw during retirement is taxed as regular income.
   - Required Minimum Distributions: Once you reach age 72, you are required to start taking minimum distributions from your account, whether you need the money or not.
   - Early Withdrawal Penalty: If you withdraw funds before age 59 1/2, you typically have to pay a 10% penalty in addition to regular income [[tax]], although there are certain exceptions.
2. Roth IRA:
   - After-[[tax]] Contributions: The money you put into a Roth IRA has already been taxed, so you get no [[tax]] deduction for contributions.
   - [[Tax]]-free Withdrawals: The money you withdraw during retirement is generally [[tax]]-free, as long as you're at least 59 1/2 and the account has been open for at least five years.
   - No Required Minimum Distributions: Unlike a traditional IRA, a Roth IRA has no mandatory distributions during the lifetime of the original owner.
   - Early Withdrawal Flexibility: You can withdraw your original contributions (but not any earnings) at any time without penalty or [[tax]]. For earnings, regular rules apply.
3. [[401k|401(k)]]:
   - Pre-[[tax]] or Roth Contributions: Depending on your plan, you may have the option to make pre-[[tax]] contributions (like a traditional IRA) or after-[[tax]] contributions (like a Roth IRA). Some plans even offer both.
   - [[Tax|Taxes]] on Withdrawals: Like an IRA, the money you withdraw during retirement from a traditional [[401k|401(k)]] is taxed as regular income. Withdrawals from a Roth [[401k|401(k)]] are [[tax]]-free.
   - Employer Match: Many employers will match a portion of your [[401k|401(k)]] contributions, which can significantly increase the value of the account.
   - Higher Contribution Limits: The annual contribution limit for a [[401k|401(k)]] is much higher than for an IRA.
   - Early Withdrawal Penalty: Similar to an IRA, there's typically a 10% penalty for withdrawing funds before age 59 1/2, with certain exceptions.
