> **SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations)** is a game theoretic approach to explain the output of any [[ML|machine learning]] model. It connects optimal credit allocation with local explanations using the classic Shapley values from game theory and their related extensions (see [papers](https://github.com/slundberg/shap#citations) for details and citations). [Welcome to the SHAP documentation -- SHAP latest documentation](https://shap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
