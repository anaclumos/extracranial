### [Photoshop for text â€” Stephan Ango](https://stephanango.com/photoshop-for-text)

- Shortly, transforming text will become as commonplace as filtering images. A new set of tools is emerging, like Photoshop for text
- Up until now, text editors have been focused on input. The next evolution of text editors will make it easy to alter, summarize and lengthen text
- Text filters will allow you to paraphrase text so that you can switch easily between styles of prose: literary, technical, journalistic, legal, and more
- You will be able to easily change an entire story chapter from first-person to third-person narration or transform narrative descriptions into dialogue
- In some ways, it is surprising that filtering text is technically challenging. The text seems like it would be easier to manipulate than images. But languages have far more rules than images do
- A reader expects writing to follow proper spelling and grammar, a consistent tone, and a logical sequence of sentences
- I'm excited to see community efforts like [[Obsidian Ava]] driving in this direction.
