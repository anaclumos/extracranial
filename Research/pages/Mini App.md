A Mini App is a lightweight, simplified application that runs within a more extensive, comprehensive [[Super App]]. Mini Apps are designed to offer specific features or services without requiring users to download, install, or update separate, full-scale applications. Super Apps, on the other hand, are multifunctional platforms that integrate multiple services, features, or third-party applications under a single user interface. They provide a seamless experience to users by eliminating the need to switch between different apps for various tasks. Examples of Super Apps include [[WeChat]] in China. These platforms incorporate services like messaging, [[e-commerce]], ride-hailing, food delivery, and digital payments within a single app, making them a one-stop shop for users' everyday needs. Developers create Mini Apps using web-based technologies like [[HTML]], [[CSS]], and [[JavaScript]] hosted by the [[Super App]], enabling faster loading times, easier discoverability, and simplified updates. By running on Super Apps, Mini Apps can benefit from the host platform's existing user base, infrastructure, and shared resources.
