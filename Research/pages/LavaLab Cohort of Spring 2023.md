[[LavaLab]] Cohort of Spring 2023.

## Trends

### More Info-focused Startups

With the recent advent of [[Generative Pre-trained Transformer|GPT]] APIs, people can now [[Generative Intelligence|generate intelligence]] on the fly, tailored for insights.

- Brief aims to solve info overload for news readers
- Documate aims to solve info overload for PDF-manual based industry, most notably the hardware industry
- Codeflow gives visual information about your codebase.
- Hive gives [[One and only]] search interface to fish your query.
- Firefly captures lost information of [[Broken Feedback Loop]].
- All tools use some [[Generative Pre-trained Transformer|GPT]] or Semantic Analysis.

### No More Crypto & [[Web3]] Startups

This was expected.

### More [[DX]] Startups.

LavaLab mostly revolved around consumer products. This time around, there are more DX-focused startups.

### Jump into the sudden void of power

After [[Zenly]] shut down, many players target that power void. It will be the most guaranteed way to success, with one catch — it's a winner-takes-all market.

### [[Interactive Articles|Interactive Instructions]]

I loved how Hive demoed their app. To demonstrate their semantic search, they made a cross puzzle to make me try out the search functions.

## Case Studies

### Firefly

It is a user review collector, but it also collects console results, cookies, and stack traces, making it super easy to collect user feedback with technical details — like [[Channel.io]] level easy.

### Brief

News recommending app, just like [[Artifact]], but it shows a one-liner explanation, so you don't need to dive into the article. A similar approach to [[Project Naroo]], by attempting [[Algorithmic Recommendation Engine for Texts]].

### Documate

Documentations tool that generates a [[Docusaurus]]-like website, given a PDF. Integrated [[Generative Pre-trained Transformer|GPT]] for semantic searches and Chat explanation: [[Conversational AI Tools for Thought]].

### Codeflow

Visualizes the dependencies of internal code and function calls. Similar to [[IntelliJ]] Flow.

### Hive

[[Search-based Tools for Thought]] for Teams. Given you connect your Google Workspace, Slack, Figma, etc., it will work as a super search.

### Beacon

Similar to [[Bondee]] and [[Zenly]].
But it aims more toward nudging people to meet each other more.
[[Nudge]]?

### Clarity

A digital library for your cosmetics & skincare product.
