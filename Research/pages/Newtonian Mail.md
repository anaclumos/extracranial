Isaac Newton communicated with his peers through the [[mail]]. He was a prolific [[Mail|letter]] writer and corresponded with numerous scientists and [[Super Brain|intellectuals]]. Newton's [[Mail|letters]] were often highly technical and discussed his scientific research and findings. In addition, he used notes to exchange ideas and collaborate with other scientists, including Robert Boyle, Christiaan Huygens, and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. [[Mail|Mails]] were Newton's [[Tools for Thought]].

In 1672, Newton first presented his theory of light and color in a [[Mail|letter]] to the Royal Society, in which he described how a prism could be used to split white light into its component colors. This [[Mail|letter]] sparked a debate among scientists, with Robert Hooke among those who challenged Newton's theory. In response to Hooke's criticism, Newton wrote a series of [[Mail|letters]] that refined and clarified his theory. These [[Mail|letters]] allowed him to consider and articulate his ideas carefully, responding to Hooke's criticisms and providing new evidence to support his theory. Newton developed and refined his ideas about light and color, ultimately leading to his groundbreaking work on optics and his book **Opticks** published in 1704.

Many of Newton's [[Mail|letters]] have been preserved and are [still available today](https://www.newtonproject.ox.ac.uk/texts/correspondence/all), providing valuable insights into his scientific thinking and the scientific community of his time. Newton's correspondence offers a fascinating glimpse into the intellectual world of the 17th and 18th centuries. Moreover, it demonstrates the critical role that [[Mail|letters]] played in the scientific and academic communities of the time.

[[Mail|Emails]] can be considered modern-day [[Mail|letters]]. I enjoy exchanging thought-provoking [[Mail|emails]] about technology and science with [[Super Brain|intellectuals]] worldwide.
