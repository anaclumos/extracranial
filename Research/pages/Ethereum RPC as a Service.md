### [Ethereum RPC as a Service](https://matt-rickard.ghost.io/rpc-as-a-service/)

- [[Google]] Cloud announced [Blockchain Node Engine](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/infrastructure-modernization/introducing-blockchain-node-engine), a hosted RPC node for Ethereum. RPC is the primary way that you query data on the [[blockchain]]. [[AWS]] offers a similar product, [AWS Managed Blockchain](https://aws.amazon.com/managed-blockchain/). Essentially these are just fully synced Ethereum nodes running [Geth](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum), the Go Ethereum client, and de facto implementation of the spec
- Not to mention, enterprise RPC providers are one of the more profitable and real [[web3]] businesses. There's Alchemy ($10.2B valuation, Feb **22), ConsenSys ($7B valuation, Mar **22), and Quicknode. The numbers might be inflated from the last cycle, but these companies have actual revenue. Maybe the markets aren't growing as prominent anymore, but it's a key infrastructure piece that isn't going anywhere
- However, while I don't think [AWS is a dumb pipe](https://matt-rickard.com/aws-is-not-a-dumb-pipe), I'm skeptical of their ability to deliver here because the developer experience is currently so terrible (vs. traditional development). Not to mention the reputational risk to their old-school enterprise customers
- Of course, maybe the best version of this business looks more like an [[API]] business where you are the sole infrastructure provider offering access to your network
