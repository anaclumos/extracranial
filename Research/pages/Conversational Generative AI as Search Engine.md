### [Wolfram|Alpha as the Way to Bring Computational Knowledge Superpowers to ChatGPT](https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/01/wolframalpha-as-the-way-to-bring-computational-knowledge-superpowers-to-chatgpt/)

- It's always amazing when things suddenly "just work" . It happened to us with [Wolfram|Alpha](https://www.wolframalpha.com/) back in 2009. It happened with our [Physics Project](https://www.wolframphysics.org/) in 2020. And it's happening now with [OpenAI](https://openai.com/)'s [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat)
- 's an interesting, essay-style response. But the actual result is wrong
- In many ways, one might say that ChatGPT never "truly understands" things; it just "knows how to produce stuff that's useful" . But it's a different story with Wolfram|Alpha. Because once Wolfram|Alpha have converted something to Wolfram Language, what it's got is a complete, precise, formal representation from which one can reliably compute things
- But just like us humans, there are times when ChatGPT needs a more formal and precise "power assist"

### [who are you - You.com](https://you.com/search?q=who+are+you&tbm=youchat)

- Hello! My name is YouChat; I'm an AI that can answer general questions, explain things, suggest ideas, translate, summarize text, compose emails, and write code for you. I'm powered by artificial intelligence and natural language processing, allowing you to have human-like conversations with me. I am constantly learning from huge amounts of information on the internet, which means I sometimes may get some answers wrong. My AI is always improving, and I often share sources for my answers.

### [Introducing NeevaAI - Neeva](https://neeva.com/blog/introducing-neevaai)

- Today, we are thrilled to launch NeevaAI â€“ an authentic, real-time AI search officially
- The introduction of accessible AI, such as the recent explosion of ChatGPT, represents one of the most exciting technological advances since the iPhone
- First, ChatGPT's output does not include sources or references. It is impossible to determine the credibility of an answer by identifying and looking up the primary source
- Second, ChatGPT does not retrieve real-time data or information. The model stops at 2021, making it less useful for the needs of current searches
- Nevada solves both of these problems
