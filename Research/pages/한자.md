Hanja (한자, 漢字) is the [[한국어|Korean]] word for Chinese characters. Hanja are Chinese characters that were borrowed and incorporated into the [[한국어|Korean language]] with Korean pronunciation. Hanja was used as early as the Gojoseon period under the first Korean kingdom. Although [[한국인|Koreans]] use Hangul, a writing system developed 500 years ago for the [[한국어|Korean language]]; Hanja is still used in conjunction with Hangul. Learning Hanja is optional for beginning [[한국어|Korean language]] students. However, because many Korean words come from [[중국|Chinese]] roots, knowing Hanja can help master enough [[Vocab|vocabulary]] to become fluent in [[한국어|Korean]].
