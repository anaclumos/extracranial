## [[American]] Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer

- [American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer: Bird, Kai, Sherwin, Martin J.: 9780375726262: Amazon.com: Books](https://www.amazon.com/American-Prometheus-Triumph-Tragedy-Oppenheimer/dp/0375726268)
- I was constantly bothered by the part where Oppenheimer had an emotional attachment and resentment of his Jewishness. The extraordinary education and influence from his Jewish community also bothered me a lot. Most likely because I also have mixed feelings about my [[한민족|Korean]] background. Much like how Oppenheimer is not only uncomfortable but also ironically homesick with his Jewishness... _His answer, given to me with tears in his eyes: 'Damn it, *I* happen to love this country.'"_
