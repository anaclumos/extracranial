- [[Mail|Letter]] to Mr. Gustav Ekerot on [[2023-02-24]]

## [[2023-02-24]]

Dear Mr. Ekerot,

I am Sunghyun — The one who sent you 10s of [[Mail|emails]] since the early days of [[tabExtend]]. I hope you are doing well. It's been a long time since we last spoke, and I'm reaching out to see how you've been doing.

I wanted to let you know that I recently changed my [[Mail|email]] address from [mail@chosunghyun.com](mailto:mail@chosunghyun.com) to [hey@cho.sh](mailto:hey@cho.sh). If you need to reach me, please use this new [[Mail|email]] address.

Also, I've been keeping a research journal on [https://cho.sh](https://cho.sh/) these days. It's a convenient platform for me to organize my thoughts and ideas. If you're interested, feel free to check it out.

I have a question about your [[WebExtension|extension]], [[tabExtend]]. I recently switched to [[Firefox]] and noticed the [[WebExtension|extension]] is unavailable on the [[Firefox]] Add-ons Store. Do you have any plans to add it? As far as I know, [[Firefox]] can "straight up" run [[Chrome]] extensions, so I imagine uploading it to the [[Firefox]] Add-ons Store wouldn't take long. It would take a maximum of 10 minutes.

Please let me know your thoughts on this. I appreciate your time and hope that you are doing well.

Best Regards,
Sunghyun Cho

Dear Mr. Ekerot,

Wow, I have not heard of such things. Jitter looks precisely like what I was looking for. I'll take a closer look later and update the website.

[[tabOS]] looks way cleaner, and I like the interface a lot. I used it for a couple of minutes, and some first thoughts:

- Love the double-click interface. It does feel like an OS. If I were using a Chromebook, this is the first [[WebExtension|extension]] I would install.
- [[Animation]] are way more fluid and polished, pushing further from the already-masterpiece [[tabExtend]].
- That being said, some of the space does seem redundant and may be utilized better. For example, the lack of Kanban like [[tabExtend]] is a huge dealbreaker for me.
- Finally, I would like the possibility of [[tabExtend]] or [[tabOS]] coming to [[Firefox|FF]] [[Firefox|🔥🦊]] [[Firefox|❤🔥]]

That said, you made me have a shower-thought if there was "[[One and Only WebExtension]]" for [[Firefox]] and [[Safari]]. It will essentially be a VM of [[Chrome]] Extensions — This One and Only [[WebExtension]] will install [[Chrome]] [[WebExtension|Extension]] within itself and proxy all of the requests to [[Safari]] & [[Firefox|FF]]. Ultimately it will bring the entire [[Chrome]] [[WebExtension|Extension]] Library to [[Firefox]] and [[Safari]]. Maybe I'll build it one day and [[Fiercely Overpriced|paywall]] it to install more than 5 extensions or so. 🤣

Anyways. Your teams always inspire me, given how small, fast, and powerful you are. I hope you keep up your great work!

Best Regards,  
Sunghyun Cho
