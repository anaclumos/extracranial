### [Mojo – a new programming language for AI developers](https://www.modular.com/mojo)

- Mojo is a new programming language designed specifically for artificial intelligence ([[AI]]) developers, with features that streamline the AI development process and make it easier to read and write code.
- Developed by the University of Washington [[Researcher|researchers]], Mojo is optimized for running on graphics processing units (GPUs) and other specialized hardware commonly used for AI research and development.
- Mojo's creators hope it will help democratize AI development, making it more accessible and manageable for programmers of all levels to create sophisticated AI applications.

#### [Industry Reactions](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35790367)

- Mojo's technical advancements, such as ownership and no garbage collection, give it an edge over competitors while still supporting current Python ecosystems
- Mojo faces competition from Triton, TVM, OpenXLA, and ONNX Runtime but offers a new option for [[ML|machine learning]] and AI developers
