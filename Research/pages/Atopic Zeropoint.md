World is progressing for the absolute good... the "Absolute."
We are here by culture, ideas, and technology.
These are the **thesis**.

How does the thesis stop?
There comes the antithesis.
It enters the dialectical struggle.
Then we get the synthesis.
When the synthesis gets established, we get the new thesis.
It repeats.

Reason and rationality move the world.
Who's pushing the ideas? Westerners.
What is the force that moves history?
What is the shared trait of western Europe?
Chediak: Christianity.
Because westerners did not define what it is to become a human, different ideas of socialism appear.
