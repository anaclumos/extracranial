In [[statistics]], the term "standard normal" usually refers to a specific type of normal distribution, also known as the standard normal distribution or the [[Gaussian]] distribution with mean 0 and [[variance]] 1. The symbol $Z$ denotes it.

The PDF of the standard normal distribution is given by:

$$ f(z) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\cdot e^{-\frac{z^2}{2}} $$

$$ z = {{x - \mu} \over \sigma} $$

where $z$ is a real number, $\pi$ is the mathematical constant Ï€, and $e$ is the mathematical constant e.

The cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the standard normal distribution, denoted by $\Phi(z)$, gives the [[probability]] that a random variable from this distribution is less than or equal to a specific value $z$. It is defined as:

$$ \Phi(z) = \int\_{-\infty}^{z}\phi(u)du $$

Where $\Phi(u)$ is the PDF of the standard normal distribution.

The standard normal distribution is important in [[statistics]] because it allows us to standardize other normal distributions with arbitrary means and standard deviations. By converting a normal distribution with mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$ to a standard normal distribution with mean 0 and [[variance]] 1, we can compare observations from different normal distributions on a standard scale. This standardization process is known as the z-score transformation.
