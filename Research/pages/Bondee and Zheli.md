[[Metadream]], the company behind [[Bondee]], was founded in Sep 2022. Bondee launched on January 7, 2023, with great quality. Bondee also topped multiple app store charts across Asia within a month. Such a Mega-hit for an early startup. They feel very **prepared** and well-established. Who's behind it?

Indeed, based on the regulatory files, one of the directors is Yang Yuxiang, a Chinese CEO who previously operated Zheli (Jelly, pronounced in Chinese), a popular social app in China, which looked identical to Bondee.
