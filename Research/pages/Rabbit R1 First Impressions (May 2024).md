Rabbit R1 is pretty awesome. Being a separate hardware form factor makes me use it more often than being an app. However, I don't think the search quality is anywhere better than the raw Perplexity GPT-3.5 search.

Rabbit R1 cannot combine internet search and image search. For example, if I point to a LEGO set and ask, "Tell me how much this LEGO set is on Amazon," it will fail.
