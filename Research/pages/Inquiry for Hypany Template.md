[[Written 100% By A Human]]

I am building [[Hypany]], an open-source tool for validating startup ideas.

Ever since Steve Jobs, founders have this weird obsession that they must know it all. But that's such a stupid guesswork. Founder as a group is its own niche and thus almost always wrongly guess the market. Lots of effort and money, and most importantly, founder's passion and youth are lost.

Thus, smart-enough people run an _idea farm_ by **[pretotyping](https://www.pretotyping.org/)**, also known as **Fake Door Testing**. You build a website first, and run ads on your targeted user groups and see if people are actually interested or not.

I have been close with the product and founding space, but unfortunately I haven't seen a SaaS that fully automates this _idea farm_. Thus, I see a potential in this idea and would like to inquire a deal.


<Accordion title="What does Hypany mean?">

It means three things.

- hypothetical company.
- hyped company.
- hyperparameter company

</Accordion>

Keywords I am looking for are:

- Warmth
- Meritocracy
- Data-driven, Always Question Yourself
- Disprove Often
- Underdog

Keywords I am not looking for are:

- Cronyism
- Nepotism
- Oligarchy
- Cold
- Being Steve Jobs

## So what's the task in hand

Surprisingly I am not seeking a SaaS design for Hypany itself. I am looking for **templates for Hypany Tenants to use**.

A user could create a **hypothesis**, which has landing pages. Like Webflow or Instapage, these page could be edited and customized for the user. I want you to research on how SaaS pages could be generalized and **reduce the parameter** of variance.

Functionally, there are some researches done online.

- [Anatomy of a high-converting app landing page](https://x.com/BreejeAnadkat/status/1920449257259123101)
- [High Converting Landing Page Blueprint](https://x.com/MarkKnd/status/1909999059231785322)
- [Anatomy of High-Converting SaaS Landing Page](https://x.com/him_uiux/status/1922258466460119234/photo/1)

They studied which components are there but did not consider how design patterns are reused and for each components, how the layouts (vertical, horizontal, bento...) and content could change. I need that study.

:::note

I am looking to strike a balance between design diversity and the least number of toggles, textboxes in the UI.

:::

The final deliverable would be a reusable template with set of parameters to tune, and a couple example of how various the design could be.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Best,  
Sunghyun


<Accordion title="Some random thoughts">

- Serial entrepreneur implies you guess the market. If you want to minimize the odds of failure you need to be a _parallel entrepreneur_. Or, [[think like a farmer]].
- Hackathons also implies the judges and panels "know the market", which I think is arrogant of them. No one can know the market. If they know the market 100% they better be investing than founding.
- Speaking of coldness, I don't want this tool to be a snobbish tool that high class Silicon Valley people use; I want it to be a welcoming, global tool
  - 2014 and 2016 Uber Logo was cold. It felt like only top tech people could use it. 2018 Uber logo became more generic and welcoming.
