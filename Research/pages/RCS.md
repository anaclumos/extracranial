RCS, or Rich Communication Services, is a messaging protocol for [[Android]] devices that provides an upgraded messaging experience. RCS is an [[alternative]] to [[Text Message|SMS]] and is similar to [[iMessage]], WhatsApp, and [[Facebook Messenger]]. RCS offers richer text features, higher-resolution images and videos, and read receipts. RCS messages are also more secure than [[Text Message|SMS]] messages because they encrypt messages from user to client. Google's Android platform enables RCS and is accessible using either Google's Android Messages app or Samsung's Messages app.
