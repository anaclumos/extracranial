> [[Project]] Jupyter aims to develop open-source software, open standards, and services for interactive computing across multiple programming languages. It was spun off from IPython in 2014 by Fernando PÃ©rez and Brian Granger. [[Project]] Jupyter's name is a reference to the three core programming languages supported by Jupyter, which are Julia, Python and R. Its name and logo are an homage to Galileo's discovery of the moons of Jupiter, as documented in notebooks attributed to Galileo. [[Project]] Jupyter has developed and supported the interactive computing products Jupyter Notebook, JupyterHub, and JupyterLab. NumFOCUS financially sponsor Jupyter.
