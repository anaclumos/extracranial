Scala is a general-purpose, high-level, multi-paradigm programming language. It's a statically typed language that includes features of functional programming and object-oriented programming. Scala stands for "Scalable Language". Its source code is compiled into bytecode and executed by the [[JVM|Java virtual machine]] ([[JVM]]).

Scala is designed to be concise and to express common programming patterns in a type-safe way. It's often used to build web applications and services, write [[back-end]] code for mobile apps, or create big data systems.

Scala is almost ten times faster than [[Python]] because it relies on the [[JVM]] during runtime. Generally, compiled languages perform faster than interpreted languages.
