HEEx stands for HTML + Embedded Elixir. It is a templating language used in the Phoenix web framework, which combines the power of Elixir with the simplicity of HTML. HEEx is an alternative to traditional HTML templates and provides a way to create reusable components using Elixir functions.

HEEx has several benefits, such as reducing duplication and making code more readable and maintainable. It also allows for easy manipulation of dynamic data, such as database queries or API responses, directly in the HTML template.

One of the unique features of HEEx is its support for embedded Elixir code, which is executed at runtime to generate dynamic HTML content. This allows developers to use Elixir's functional programming constructs, such as pattern matching and recursion, to create powerful and flexible HTML templates.
