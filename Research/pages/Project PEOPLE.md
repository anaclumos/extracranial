Project PEOPLE is a mass-scale interview project.
It aims to interview at least 1K people, either online or offline.
No information will be provided on any individuals except for their occupation.

:::tip
I randomize the list (on every page load) and the sidebar (on every site build) to prevent anyone on the top from getting all the attention 😉
Try refreshing the page!
