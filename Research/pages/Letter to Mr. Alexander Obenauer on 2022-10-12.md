- [[Mail|Letter]] to Mr. Alexander Obenauer on 2022-10-12

Dear Mr. Obenauer,

I am Sunghyun Cho. I am a current CS university student at USC.
I want to become a computer scientist in the future, just like you!

I just wanted to say that your website is ðŸ”¥.
I love how you created "Zettlekasten" Lab Notes!
I am also profoundly interested in Computing and how information gets represented on the web.
My notes are on [https://cho.sh](https://cho.sh/). Please take a look!

I'll take a deeper look into your website after my midterm tomorrow ðŸ˜­.

Hope we can keep in touch!

Best regards,
Sunghyun

Dear Mr. Obenauer,

I do not currently have a [[newsletter]]. I was looking for a developer-friendly mailing platform (Substack knocks off here).
I tried using Mailgun before and didn't like it, but I don't want to bother dealing with [[AWS]] SES.
I've heard good things about Revue, although I haven't tried it.
Is there any good platform you would recommend?

Best Regards,  
Sunghyun Cho
