Whenever you have an unexplainable disgust for something, think it in reverse -- aren't you _sourgraping_ it because you cannot have it?

It happened to me. The [[United States of America|United States]] sucked a lot in various ways. After months of self-contemplations, I concluded that I was _sourgraping_ the [[United States of America|United States]] because I could not have it / embrace it (in the short term).

Yes, the [[United States of America|U.S.]] sucks in some ways, but it's essential to separate the personal emotions and step back to SWOT the situation correctly.

It took me some effort to separate my emotions and neutrally analyze the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats in the [[United States of America|United States]]. While I wouldn't say I like some aspects of the [[United States of America|United States]], I hereby acknowledge that opportunity and capital-wise, the [[United States of America|United States]] is the global destination. It's wise to stay in the middle gray area of [[대한민국|Korea]] and the [[United States of America|U.S.]] to take advantage of both countries.
