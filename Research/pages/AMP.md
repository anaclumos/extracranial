> AMP (originally an acronym for Accelerated Mobile Pages) is an open-source HTML framework developed by the AMP Open Source Project. Google created it as a competitor to Facebook Instant Articles and Apple News. AMP is optimized for mobile web browsing and intended to help webpages load faster. AMP pages may be cached by a [[CDN]], such as [[Microsoft]] Bing or Cloudflare's AMP caches, which allows pages to be served more quickly.
