> In [[internationalization]], CJK character is a collective term for the [[중국어|Chinese]], [[일본어|Japanese]], and [[한국어|Korean]] languages, which include [[한자|Chinese characters]] and derivatives in their writing systems, sometimes paired with other scripts. The CJK characters often have [[한자|Hànzì]] in [[중국어|Chinese]], [[한자|Kanji]], and Kana in [[일본어|Japanese]] and Hanja and Hangul in [[한국어|Korean]]. Vietnamese can be included, making the abbreviation CJKV, as Vietnamese historically used [[한자|Chinese characters]] which they were known as Chữ Hán and Chữ Nôm in Vietnamese (Hán-Nôm altogether).
