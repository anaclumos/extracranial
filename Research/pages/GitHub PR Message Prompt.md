Write a comprehensive git pull request info for this diff. Consider on:

- What should be the title of this PR? It should follow a conventional PR title, starting with (feature) or (housekeeping) or (bugfix), etc.
- What are the significant features?
- Which files are essential components?
- What dependencies are added? Why are they useful?
- If an existing file is refactored, what's the critical difference?
- If a config file, such as eslint or prettier has changed, what is the difference?

Ignore all other noises, such as formatting changes, dead code elimination, or trivial package updates.

Use Markdown headings. Keep everything concise and direct.
