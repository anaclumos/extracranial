Habit formation is a powerful tool that can help us achieve our goals and improve our overall well-being. Over the next 64 days, I must identify the habits I want to build, create a plan for making them stick, and hold each other accountable as I work toward making these habits a permanent part of our lives.

## Things to consider

- Atomic while long term. At least 64 days.
- Should look extremely trivial (for example, "walk 15 minutes"). Don't make things grandiose. Sixty-four days is an extended period, and your initial morale will diminish quickly.
- Never false report. It is okay to break things sometimes.
- Hold up to two projects at one time.
