"Create React App" is a popular command line interface tool (CLI) from Facebook that helps developers create new React.js applications with little to no configuration. It's designed to get a developer up and running with a stable development environment as quickly as possible, bypassing the potentially complex process of setting up a new project from scratch, however, due to its lack of [[Server-side Rendering]], it is now discouraged to use.
