> React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a free and open-source [[Front-end|front-end]] JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on UI components. It is maintained by Meta (formerly Facebook) and a community of individual developers and companies. React can be used as a base in the development of single-page, mobile, or server-rendered applications with frameworks like Next.js. However, React is only concerned with state management and rendering that state to the [[DOM]], so creating React applications usually requires additional libraries for routing and certain client-side functionality.
