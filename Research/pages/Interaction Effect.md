An interaction effect in user experiments or statistical analysis refers to a situation where the impact of one variable on an outcome depends on the level of another variable. Related: [[Independence]]. Interaction can be examined in different types of models, such as in regression analysis or analysis of variance (ANOVA), but the basic idea is the same.

In the case of two-way interaction (interaction between two independent variables), let's denote our variables as follows:

- $X$ and $Y$ are your independent variables.
- $Z$ is your dependent variable.
- $XY$ represents the interaction between $X$ and $Y$.

In a regression model that includes an interaction term, the model would look like this:

$$
Z = \beta_0 + \beta_1X + \beta_2Y + \beta_3XY + \epsilon
$$

Here, $\beta_0$ is the intercept, $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$ are the main effects of $X$ and $Y$ respectively, and $\beta_3$ represents the interaction effect of $X$ and $Y$ on $Z$. $\epsilon$ is the error term.

To calculate the interaction effect, you need to estimate the regression coefficients $\beta_0, \beta_1, \beta_2,$ and $\beta_3$. This is typically done through a method called Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression, which minimizes the sum of the squared residuals. In a factorial ANOVA setting, you would calculate the interaction effect as the difference between the effect of one factor at different levels of the other factor.
