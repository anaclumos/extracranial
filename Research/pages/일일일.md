[[NewsGPT]] Model. A competitor to [[Project Heimdall]].

## What I don't like

- Too strong ties to [[대한민국|Korean]] Market
  - Ex) domain, [[kakaotalk]], website...
  - You can only get so big as the market
- Too much curation: too 'optimized'

  - [[Project Heimdall]] aims to build the International mesh of [[METI Engine]]. If humans get involved in the pipeline
