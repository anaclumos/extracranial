### [Instagram's co-founders launch Artifact, a kind of TikTok for text - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/31/23579552/artifact-instagram-cofounders-kevin-systrom-mike-krieger-news-app)

- The Instagram co-founders, [who departed Facebook in 2018](https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/15/17979282/kevin-systrom-instagram-quitting-ceo-facebook) amid tensions with their parent company, have formed a new venture to explore ideas for next-generation social apps

- The tech that enabled [[ChatGPT]] also created new possibilities for social networks
- Artifact will take seriously the job of serving readers with high-quality news and information
