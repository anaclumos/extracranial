> [[Palantir]] Apollo is a continuous delivery system that manages and deploys [[Palantir Gotham]] and Foundry. Apollo was built out of the need for customers to use multiple public and private cloud platforms as part of their infrastructure. Apollo orchestrates updates to configurations and software in the Foundry and Gotham platforms using a micro-service architecture. This product allows Palantir to provide [[software as a service]] ([[Software as a Service|SaaS]]) rather than to operate as a consulting company.
