- A terminal is a text input/output environment. Historically, it was a physical device (keyboard + display). Today, it refers to software emulators (e.g., GNOME Terminal, Windows Terminal) that let users interact with a shell.
- A shell is a command-line interpreter. It takes user input, parses it, and executes commands. Examples: `bash`, `zsh`, `fish`, `sh`.
- TTY was originally a hardware, now a virtual device in Unix-like systems representing a terminal session. Each `tty` (e.g., `/dev/tty1`, `/dev/pts/0`) maps to a physical or virtual text interface.
- Console is a main physical or virtual terminal directly connected to the system. On Linux, `/dev/console` refers to the system console, often used for kernel messages and emergency access.
