- Happened from [[2023-07-30]]-[[2023-08-01]], or something like that
- Bunch of bots started to sign up for Simplified Chinese, like 300 people
- Felt great, yeah, here we go
- So I moved forward with the [[Project Heimdall]] migration, added new languages
- Now I got a bunch of people signing up for `ta` Tamil. Like 40 people
- Something was weird.
- One thing in common was that both lists that got tons of subscribers were the last list on [[Listmonk]].
- Seemed like an attack of some sort. I tried emailing a handpicked few, but none replied.
- The [[Mail|emails]] were very authentic-looking, though. So it took a lot of work to tell which one was bogus or not.
- So I tried adding an empty list and explicitly said "do not subscribe" on the list. Sure enough, a bunch of people still signed up. Look at these messes. Also, don't they look so authentic?

- One odd thing was that usually when a subscriber signs up for [[Project Heimdall|Heimdall]], the name field was the handle from the [[Mail|email]] company. These bogus subscribers had something like [[UUID]].
- Anyways, so I had to inspect all subscribers and batch-delete 400 subscribers.
- Also, blocked public subscription page.

- Why did anyone do this?
- I am not sure, but one thing for sure is that now I got a warning from [[AWS]]. A competitor in the space?
