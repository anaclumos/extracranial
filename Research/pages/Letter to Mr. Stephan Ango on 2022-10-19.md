Dear Engineer Ango,

I am Sunghyun Cho, a computer science student based in [[Los Angeles]].
I recently came across your article on [[Photoshop for Text]] and was deeply inspired by it.
I am also heavily interested in Tools for Thought and Digital Brains and would like to keep in touch.
I also have a [[Memex]] or, in my term, _[[Extracranial]]_ at [https://cho.sh](https://cho.sh/).

You also have your page there!

- Your Page: [https://cho.sh/r/6A9784](https://cho.sh/r/6A9784)
- [[Generative Intelligence]]. [https://cho.sh/r/9A0D39](https://cho.sh/r/9A0D39)

If you are wondering, yes, I use [[Obsidian]] for my [[Memex]], but I have built a custom [[React]] application for presenting on the web instead of [[Obsidian]] Publish.
You are located here :)

I hope we can keep in touch!

Best Regards,  
Sunghyun Cho

## Update on [[2022-10-20]]

- Got a positive response, asking out if it is open-sourced.

Dear Engineer Ango,

Thank you for your feedback!

My website is already open-source here: [https://github.com/anaclumos/extracranial](https://github.com/anaclumos/extracranial).

I have some personal Python scripts that convert [[Obsidian]] MD files to [[Docusaurus]] MD files since they have slightly different specs.
Namely, [[Docusaurus]] does not support `wikilinks` and `image-wikilinks`.
It also lacks any backlinking support and graph visualization.
I've been contributing to [[Docusaurus]] & talking with [[Docusaurus]] core devs, and these features will not come soon because it involves a pretty significant revamp or underlying link management system. [https://github.com/anaclumos/extracranial/tree/main/tools](https://github.com/anaclumos/extracranial/tree/main/tools)

Also, I wanted to ask, is your website also open-source? I wasn't able to find any relevant repositories.

Best Regards,  
Sunghyun Cho
