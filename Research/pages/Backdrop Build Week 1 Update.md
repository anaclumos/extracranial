## One-liner

Customizable Keyword Reports in 30 Languages

## What are you building?

You tell the tool what you're interested in â€” it could be anything like "sustainable fashion," "AI developments," or even "new coffee trends." Then, my AI goes into the digital world, gathers information about your topic, and composes a neat summary. The best part? It can do this in 30 different languages, so if you're curious about what's happening on the other side of the world in a foreign language, no problem!

## Who are your ideal users?

- Small to Mid-Sized Business Owners, especially those who don't have the resources to hire a dedicated team for market research. It's like having a mini market research department at a fraction of the cost.
- Content Creators and Bloggers, particularly those focusing on niche topics or trends. This helps them create relevant, timely content that resonates with their audience.
- Professionals in Dynamic Industries. The tool can provide these professionals with the latest buzzwords, consumer trends, and competitive insights, helping them to strategize effectively.
- Academic [[Researcher|Researchers]] and Students, especially those conducting research in rapidly evolving fields. The tool can help them stay abreast of the latest studies, findings, and discussions in their study area.

## What have you shipped this week?

I built an MVP in which users can hardcode their keywords, and the worker will scrape, summarize, translate, and send the report. So, the AI engine itself is finished; it just needs a better house to live in. I plan on building a website where users can sign up and Create, Read, Update, and Delete their keywords.
