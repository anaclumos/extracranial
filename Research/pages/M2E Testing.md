Not end-to-end testing.

Middle-to-end testing.

If you test frontend and backend, you talk with API

E2E testing verifies everything works as expected from frontend click to backend trigger and then frontend value check

M2E on FE only checks if frontend fires the correct APIs

M2E on BE only checks if given the same API input it generates the correct output
