Dear Mr. [[Matt Rickard|Rickard]],

AFAIK Ghost is [[Node.js]], not Rails! [https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost)

But you have a great point; you once mentioned that most tech services could be abstracted to an [[edge]]-served [[Front-end]] and [[back-end]] as [[edge]]-replicated simple data storage. I was also a long-time Ghost user, and I agree that Ghost's tech stack can be vastly simplified as such. Ghost's central-hosted-ness was helpful in some niches (ex: I can keep writing where I left off on my other devices), but Ghost, or "Writing Services," can be much better.

It would be much better to see a first-class [[serverless]] [[Mail|email]] [[API]] (as in doing slightly more than Nodemailer or EmailEngine, i.e., [[SMIME]] or, more recently â€” [[BIMI|Brand Indicators for Message Identification]] [[BIMI]]) Just like what [[Vercel]] did to Heroku.

Best Regards,

Sunghyun Cho
