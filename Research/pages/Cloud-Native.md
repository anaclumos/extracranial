Cloud Native generations of software engineers refer to those developers who are familiar with and prefer cloud-native development practices and technologies. They have grown up in an era where cloud computing is the norm and take for granted the benefits that cloud computing offers, such as scalability, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness.

These software engineers are accustomed to deploying applications on cloud infrastructure, such as [[AWS]], instead of traditional on-premise infrastructure. They are comfortable building [[Microservices Architecture]], containerization, and [[automation]] using tools like Kubernetes, [[Docker]], and Terraform.

Cloud Native software engineers are familiar with modern application design patterns and practices, such as DevOps, continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD), and [[serverless]] computing. They leverage these practices to build applications that can be deployed and scaled quickly and efficiently in the cloud.

I am cloud-native, and [[AI-native]], and that is my edge.
