Historically, both mail and email have been central to the dissemination and collaboration that drive research. They've helped researchers connect with each other and with the public, increasing the speed and reach of scientific progress. They've also played a significant role in other key aspects of the research process, like gathering data, seeking funding, recruiting participants for studies, and obtaining ethical approval for research.
