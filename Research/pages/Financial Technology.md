> Fintech, a portmanteau of "financial technology," refers to firms using new technology to compete with traditional financial methods in delivering financial services. [[AI|Artificial intelligence]], [[Blockchain]], Cloud computing, and big data are regarded as the "ABCD" (four key areas) of FinTech. The use of smartphones for mobile banking, investing, borrowing services, and cryptocurrency are examples of technologies designed to make financial services more accessible to the general public. Financial technology companies consist of both startups and established financial institutions and technology companies trying to replace or enhance the usage of financial services provided by existing financial companies. A subset of fintech companies that focus on the insurance industry is collectively known as insurtech or insuretech companies.
