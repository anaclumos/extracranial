### [Apple's Feedback Mechanism is Broken -- Liss is More](https://www.caseyliss.com/2022/6/20/feedback-is-broken-stop-trying-to-make-radar-happen)

- The author experienced a half-year-long silence before knowing he needed one line of code change to fix the bug.

I also submitted 18 feedbacks since 2017-ish and only heard back once.
However, [[Apple]] Feedback Assistant is not a developer Q&A platform.
The author points out that the feedback assistant is broken, but the author also wrongfully accuses a product.
