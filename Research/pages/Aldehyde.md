> In organic chemistry, an aldehyde is an organic compound containing a functional group with the structure R-**CH=O**.

Aldehyde is the codename for this very website.

Aldehyde is a part of Project Extracranial. Project Extracranial covers the entire workflow of delegating a second brain, while Aldehyde only focuses on the operations on `https://cho.sh` website and its exposition so that all records are neatly organized and readily available online. Some notes, visible in Project Extracranial, won't be available on Aldehyde.
