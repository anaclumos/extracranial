## [How to hack Hacker News (and consistently hit the front page)](https://www.indiehackers.com/post/how-to-hack-hacker-news-and-consistently-hit-the-front-page-56b4a04e12)

Your content needs to be either:

- Newsworthy
- Investigative (research)

### The War Room

1. Fetch data from Hacker News [[API]]
2. Set up Google Alerts for your query
3. Fetch data from Google Alerts XML
4. Enrich data and store it in an SQLite file with a cronjob
5. Send alerts with another cronjob to Twist [[API]] or Telegram [[API]]
6. Then add chatGPT in the mix and ask for a rating between 0-100 and why the article is getting that rating. We send ourselves alerts when the rating is 30+
