### [Apple Safari browser might become the new Internet Explorer â€¢ The Register](https://www.theregister.com/2021/10/22/safari_risks_becoming_the_new_ie/)

- [[Apple]] has a [[Web Browser|browser]] monopoly on iOS, which is something [[Microsoft]] was never able to achieve with IE
- The reality is if you have an iOS device, you use Safari and are bound by its limitations
- [[Apple]] updates Safari roughly every six months at best. [Blink](https://www.chromium.org/blink)\-based [[Web Browser|browsers]] update every six weeks (soon every four), Firefox releases every four weeks, and Brave releases every three. This means that not only is [[Apple]] slow to add new features, but its development cycle means that even simple bug fixes have to wait a long time before they land on users' devices
- [[Apple]] hasn't added support for sending notifications and home screen icons. In essence, [[Apple]] hasn't implemented some of the core features that make websites able to behave in an app-like way
  - At least [[2022-12-28]] now they do: [Sending web push notifications in Safari and other browsers](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/sending_web_push_notifications_in_safari_and_other_browsers)

### [Safari's date-picker is the cause of 1/3 of our customer support issues](https://gist.github.com/RobertAKARobin/850a408e04d5414e67d308a2b5847378)

- There is no option to enter the correct date manually. The only obvious path forward is tapping the left arrow button 924 times to return to 1945. The not-obvious way ahead -- which our elderly users cannot find -- is to tap "December 2022", which pops open this Rolodex-type thing
- The need to swipe up and down on the "rollers" is not apparent to those who weren't born during the Digital Age
