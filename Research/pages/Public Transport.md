### [49-Euro-Ticket Deutschlandticket for buses and trains](https://www.deutschland.de/en/topic/life/49-euro-ticket-deutschlandticket-for-buses-and-trains)

Germany plans to introduce a €49 ($55) monthly ticket for regional transport across the country, allowing passengers to use buses and trains in cities including Berlin, Hamburg, and Munich. The offer, expected to start on 1 April 2023, is part of a tariff reform described as the biggest ever in the country's local public transport system. The ticket aims to make traveling by bus and train more attractive and encourage more people to switch to climate-friendly modes of transport. German Rail plans to introduce more modern and faster trains and expand and renovate routes to improve infrastructure and punctuality.
