LINE is a free app, built by [[Naver]], that offers messaging, voice chat, and video calling. It also allows users to meet new people through OPENCHAT. LINE is available for download on mobile phones ([[Android]] and [[iOS]]), PC, and Macs. LINE uses end-to-end encryption to protect messages and calls from being intercepted by third parties. This means that only you and the person you're communicating with can read or hear the content of your messages and calls. LINE was first released to the public in June 2011, the fastest-growing mobile messenger app in the world.
