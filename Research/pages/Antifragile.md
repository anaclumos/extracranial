Antifragile is a concept introduced by Nassim Nicholas Taleb in his book "Antifragile: Things That Gain from Disorder". It refers to systems or entities that survive stressors or shocks and thrive and become stronger. The opposite of antifragility is fragility, where a system becomes weaker or more vulnerable under stress. Antifragility applies to many different areas, such as economies, ecosystems, and human physiology.
