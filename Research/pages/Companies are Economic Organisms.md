Some time ago, I wrote that companies are [[Economy|economic]] [[engine]] of some sort. Engines, however, are difficult to visualize and internalize. So a better analogy will be that **companies are economic organisms**. That is, how are you going to feed the company? Where will you scout for food? How will you defecate?
