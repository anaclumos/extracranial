Jiro Horikoshi, a well-known [[일본인|Japanese]] aeronautical engineer, was responsible for designing the Mitsubishi A6M Zero, a famous fighter aircraft utilized by the Imperial [[일본|Japanese]] Navy throughout World War II. Despite his deep interest in producing planes with optimal aerodynamic capabilities, he was troubled by the devastation and loss of life that resulted from his designs being employed as weapons of war. He was reportedly suffering from the destruction caused by his inventions. Some argue that he is a war criminal, but at the same time, he is just an engineer who tried his best at one point in history, just like [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]].
