Reddit Place, initially, was a social experiment held on Reddit for April Fool's Day in 2017. It consisted of a 1000x1000 pixel canvas where Reddit users could change one pixel every 5 minutes. The project began on March 31, 2017, and ended on April 3, 2017. During this time, users created, collaborated, and battled over designs. This resulted in a wide variety of pixel art, national flags, logos, and other representations of various subreddits. The final image represents a cross-section of the internet culture of that time, with multiple memes, icons, and symbols present. After the event concluded, the final state of the canvas remained available as a permanent page on Reddit.
