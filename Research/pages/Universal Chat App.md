A universal chat is a single, centralized chat service or platform that every internet user is part of, much like a ubiquitous social media network or [[Mail|email]] service. It facilitates communication among all its users without them needing to be on separate platforms or use different applications.

## Asia

Asia has multiple universal chats, depending on the region.

1. **[[WeChat]] (China)**. Developed by Tencent, [[WeChat]] is more than just a messaging app; it's a complete social ecosystem. As of my last knowledge update in September 2021, [[WeChat]] was the most popular app in China, with over a billion active users. [[WeChat]] offers features like text messaging, voice, and video calls, a news feed (similar to [[Facebook]]'s), [[Mini App|mini-programs]] (small apps that run within [[WeChat]] itself), and WeChat Pay, allowing users to make digital payments.
2. **[[KakaoTalk]] ([[대한민국|Korea]])**. Developed by [[Kakao]] Corporation, [[KakaoTalk]] is a free mobile instant messaging application for smartphones with free text and free call features. It is the dominant messaging app in [[대한민국|Korea]], used by a vast majority of smartphone users in the country. In addition to messaging and calling, it offers various services such as digital payments ([[KakaoPay]]), a news feed, music streaming, and even taxi-hailing.
3. **[[Line]] ([[일본|Japan]])**. Developed by [[Naver]], a [[대한민국|Korean]] search portal, Line is widely used in [[일본|Japan]], [[대만|Taiwan]], and Thailand. In addition to messaging and free calls, it includes a timeline to share photos, statuses, and comments. It also has Line Pay for payments and additional features like Line Music, Line Taxi, and various games.

## Europe

In the [[EU]], it's slightly more complicated. Most people use WhatsApp.

1. **WhatsApp**. Owned by [[Meta (Company)|Facebook]], WhatsApp is a free messaging app available for [[Android]] and other smartphones. It uses the internet to let you message and call friends and family, so you don't have to pay for every message or call.
2. **[[Facebook Messenger]]**. Also owned by [[Meta (Company)|Facebook]], [[Facebook Messenger|Messenger]] is a messaging platform that allows for text messages, voice calls, and video calls to people on the [[Facebook]] platform.
3. **Viber**. Owned by the [[일본|Japanese]] company Rakuten, Viber is a free messaging and calling app that provides a secure connection, high-quality calls, and the ability to send texts, photos, and videos.

## [[United States of America|U.S.]]

In the Americas, there is no such universal chat app. Younger generations use [[iMessage]], while elderlies use WhatsApp. Or often, everyone sticks to texting.

1. **[[iMessage]]**. This is a built-in messaging service on [[Apple]] devices, including iPhones, iPads, and Macs. It supports text messages, photos, videos, and other types of content. However, it only works between [[Apple]] devices, which is a limitation if you're trying to communicate with someone who uses an [[Android]] phone or a Windows PC.

## Protocol Propositions

On the **direct messages** aspect,

- [[Matrix Network]]. Used by [[Beeper]]. [[Beeper]] aims to build a [[Matrix Network|Matrix]] bridge for all social networks.
- [[MLS]]. Backed by [[Google]] and IETF.
- [[RCS]]. Backed by [[Google]] and Samsung.

More on the **social network** aspect,

- [[AT protocol]]. Initially proposed by Jack Dorsey from [[Twitter]], but after the [[Musk-Twitter Incident]], Dorsey founded [[Bluesky]]. [[AT Protocol]] is actively maintained by [[Bluesky]].
- [[ActivityPub]] protocol: Backed by [[Threads (Service)]] and [[Mastodon]].
