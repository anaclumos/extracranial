### [Wolfram Alpha as the Way to Bring Computational Knowledge Superpowers to ChatGPT](https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/01/wolframalpha-as-the-way-to-bring-computational-knowledge-superpowers-to-chatgpt/)

- It's always amazing when things suddenly "just work". It happened to us with [Wolfram|Alpha](https://www.wolframalpha.com/) back in 2009. It happened with our [Physics Project](https://www.wolframphysics.org/) in 2020. And it's happening now with [OpenAI](https://openai.com/)'s [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat)
- a fascinating, essay-style response. But the actual result is wrong
- In many ways, one might say that [[ChatGPT]] never "truly understands" things; it just "knows how to produce stuff that's useful". But it's a different story with Wolfram|Alpha. Because once Wolfram|Alpha has converted something to Wolfram Language, what it's got is a complete, precise, formal representation from which one can reliably compute things
- But just like us humans, there are times when [[ChatGPT]] needs a more formal and precise "power assist."

### [who are you - You. com](https://you.com/search?q=who+are+you&tbm=youchat)

- Hello! My name is YouChat; I'm an [[AI]] that can answer general questions, explain things, suggest ideas, translate, summarize text, compose [[Mail|emails]], and write code for you. I'm powered by [[AI|artificial intelligence]] and [[natural language processing]], allowing you to have human-like conversations with me. I am constantly learning from vast amounts of online information, so I sometimes need to correct some answers. My [[AI]] is constantly improving, and I often share sources for my answers.

### [Introducing NeevaAI - Neeva](https://neeva.com/blog/introducing-neevaai)

- Today, we are thrilled to launch NeevaAI – an authentic, real-time [[AI]] search officially
- The introduction of accessible [[AI]], such as the recent explosion of [[ChatGPT]], represents one of the most exciting technological advances since the iPhone
- First, [[ChatGPT]]'s output does not include sources or references. It is impossible to determine the credibility of an answer by identifying and looking up the primary source
- Second, [[ChatGPT]] does not retrieve real-time data or information. The model stops at 2021, making it less useful for the needs of current searches
- Nevada solves both of these problems

## On [[ChatGPT]]

After playing with it for two days, It's marvelous.
We will never see [[The Demise of Chatbots in 2017]] again.
This can kill [[Google]].
People want information, not data.
People, in the past, searched (and used [[Google]]) because it was the best bet to find information.

But if an [[AI]] can search **for you** and only return the trim down the **answer**, why would anyone take the effort to find [[Information amongst Data]]?

> 20여년 이어져온 [[Google|구글]]의 시대가 끝나가는 것이 느껴져요. 아, [[Google|구글]]이라는 회사 말고, [[Google|구글]]이라는 검색이요. 원래 사람들이 원하는 것은 검색이 아니고 정답이거든요. 다만 그 동안은 정답을 얻을 수가 없었기에 검색을 했을 뿐이지요. 그런데 이제 [[AI|인공지능]] 덕분에 진짜 답을 얻을 수 있게 되어가고 있어요. 그럼 검색은 더 이상 필요 없어지는 것이지요. 엊그제 나온 [[OpenAI]]의 [[ChatGPT]]에 많은 사람들이 놀라고 있어요. 모든 것의 정답을 주지는 못 하는데요. 그래도 모든 것의 정답을 주는 기계의 느낌이 살짝 나긴 해요. [[Google|구글]](검색)의 시대는 끝나가고 있어요. 아참, 새 시대도 [[Google|구글]](회사)가 열 가능성이 꽤 크긴 해요. [[Google|구글]]이 ([[Microsoft|마이크로소프트]] 등이 그랬던 것처럼) 자기 스스로를 죽일 수 있다면 [[Google|구글]]에게도 기회가 있을 텐데요. [[Google|구글]]이 딥러닝에 투자 하는 것을 보면... [[Google|구글]]은 다시 태어날 준비는 충분히 되어 있는 듯 해요. [Sedong Nam](https://www.facebook.com/dgtgrade/posts/5846987125360105)
