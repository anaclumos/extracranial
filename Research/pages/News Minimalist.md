[Minimalist news site powered by AI | Boing Boing](https://boingboing.net/2023/05/04/minimalist-news-site-powered-by-ai.html)

[News Minimalist](https://www.newsminimalist.com/) is another site that presents topical headlines in a plain, fast-loading format. This one aims not for the old-timey plaintext look but for the contemporary darkmodish style, garnished with data science. It uses AI, ChatGPT-4, to determine "significant news", which creator Vadim Yakhin frames with delicious blitheness:

- Magnitude: how big was the effect;
- Scale: how many people the event affected;
- Potential: how likely is it that the event will cause more significant events;
- Credibility: how credible is the source?
