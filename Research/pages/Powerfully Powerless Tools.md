Some tools must choose to be dumbed down. PKM tools are one example.

There is a repeated paradigm in the [[Tools for Thought]] [[Software as a Service]] market.
They are **too complicated** to use. Calendars, Objects, Comments, Backnotes, Blocks, Tasks, etc, etc, etc...

To pull out the most from these tools, you must first grow some skillfulness in these tools and aggregate enough information over a threshold. For team tools, you must ensure this for every member.
If you're choosing a tool based on what features it includes, instead of **where it can take you**,
it's like when you prepare for an exam, you try to make a perfect note instead of actually _studying_.

To successfully harness the productivity tool, you must _flow_ at one point.
Tools and infra fade out, and you only focus on the content.
That is, our brain must outpace the tool; our brain must work more than the tool.
Even [[Notion]] is too complicated for personal task management.

Based on my experience, tools must have the minimum friction, only having...

- Journal. You write daily notes.
- From there on, highlight keywords by adding double brackets.
- Regularly explore the double-bracketed keywords. Write more details.
- Voila! You realize that things are interrelated in a way you never imagined.
