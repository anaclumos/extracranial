## [[Alexander Obenauer]]

- [Mail Pilot](https://www.mailpilot.app/) is an [[Mail|email]] client that introduced new perspectives and useful features to [[Mail|email]] in 2012, such as reminders, which was later adopted by other apps as "snooze". After a record-breaking Kickstarter campaign, [[Mail]] Pilot went on to become the #1 paid app in the Mac [[App Store]] at launch. It is available today as a native app for macOS, [[iOS|iPadOS]], and [[iOS]].
- [Throttle](https://throttlehq.com/) is a service that introduced sender-specific addresses in 2015 to give [[Mail|email]] receivers fine-grained oversight and control over the transactional and bulk [[Mail|email]] headed their way, and is often turned to as a home away from the inbox for less urgent [[Mail|email]].
