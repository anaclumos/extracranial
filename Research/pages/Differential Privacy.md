Differential privacy is a framework for designing algorithms that enable statistical data analysis while protecting the privacy of individuals whose data is included in the calculation. The goal of differential privacy is to provide strong privacy guarantees that limit what can be learned about any individual's data while still allowing functional aggregate statistical analysis to be performed on the data as a whole.

The basic idea behind differential privacy is to add random noise to the data, making it difficult to identify any individual's data in the aggregate results. This noise is carefully calibrated to preserve the overall accuracy of the statistical analysis while protecting the privacy of the individual data points.

Formally, an algorithm is said to be differentially private if

- the algorithm's output is essentially the same,
- whether any individual's data is included or excluded from the input.

In other words, the presence or absence of any individual's data should not significantly impact the algorithm's output.

Differential privacy has become an increasingly important area of research as concerns about data privacy have grown in recent years. It is essential in healthcare, [[finance]], and government, where the privacy of individual data points is crucial for maintaining trust in the system.
