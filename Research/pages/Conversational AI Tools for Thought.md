### [Poe beta test starting - Quora](https://www.quora.com/profile/Adam-DAngelo/Poe-beta-test-starting)

> Today we are starting a beta test for a new product called Poe. Short for "Platform for Open Exploration", it lets people ask questions, get instant answers, and have back-and-forth dialogue with AI. Poe will initially be available on iOS, and it will be invite only until we work out scalability, get feedback from beta testers, and address any other issues that come up. After we get through this phase, we will open up to everyone and add support for all platforms. If you're interested in joining the beta to try Poe, you can download the app and join the waiting list [here](https://poe.quora.com/ 'poe.quora.com'). Adam D'Angelo, Quora CEO
