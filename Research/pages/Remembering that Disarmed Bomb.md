Heinrich's 300-29-1 Model states that before one major industrial accident occurs, at least 300 near misses and 29 minor accidents occur. Major accidents only happen if we ignore all of those alert signals. This applies at a societal and personal level; you will make one terrible mistake if you ignore all the portents.

But on the other hand, are we paying our homage to the antiterrorist groups who disarm all those potential threats? Preventing such accident often comes in the form of double-checking mundane stuff, which we do dozen times a day.

- Did you turn off the fire switch?
- Did you check your car had a safety checkup?
- Are you sure you're taking care of your medical state?

It's a simple question that we can always ask. But we don't realize that these double-checkings are heroic actions that prevented a potential disaster.

We consistently disregard these cautious behaviors as useless concerns. But that lack of attention snowballs and cascades to something serious, then we inveigh those few events.

> Do you remember those disarmed terrors that you prevented yesterday?
