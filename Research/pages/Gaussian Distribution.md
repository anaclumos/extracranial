The [[Gaussian]] [[distribution]], also known as the normal [[distribution]], is a continuous [[probability]] [[distribution]] commonly used in statistical analysis. It is defined by the mean (μ) and the standard deviation (σ).

The PDF of the [[Gaussian]] [[distribution]] is given by:

$$

f(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2\pi}} \cdot e^{-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}


$$

where $x$ is an actual number, $\mu$ is the mean of the [[distribution]], $\sigma$ is the standard deviation, $\pi$ is the mathematical constant π, and $e$ is the mathematical constant e.

The [[Gaussian]] [[distribution]] is symmetric about the mean, with the highest [[probability]] density occurring at the mean. As the standard deviation increases, the [[distribution]] becomes more expansive and flatter.

One of the critical properties of the [[Gaussian]] [[distribution]] is that about 68% of the observations fall within one standard deviation of the mean, about 95% of the observations fall within two standard deviations of the mean, and about 99.7% of the observations fall within three standard deviations of the mean.

The [[Gaussian]] [[distribution]] is widely used in various fields, such as physics, engineering, [[Economy|economics]], and social sciences, due to its flexibility and ability to model many real-world phenomena. It is also a foundational concept in statistical inference, which involves making inferences about a population based on a sample of data.
