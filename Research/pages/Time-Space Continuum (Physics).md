The time-space continuum is a concept in physics that combines the three dimensions of space (length, width, and height) with the fourth dimension of time into a single, interconnected framework known as "spacetime." Spacetime is the backdrop against which all physical phenomena occur, and it is central to the theories of relativity developed by Albert Einstein.
