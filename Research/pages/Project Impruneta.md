TL;DR:

> What happens if we record-link Malmantile? (VFL CIFAR-10)

Impruneta is a subproject of [[Project Florence]]. Supercedes [[Project Malmantile]]

## Method

We divided the images into 16 sections, like in [[Project Malmantile]], but we averaged the weights for each image while ensuring they were the same training data.

## Control Group

Ran entire ten epochs with the original dataset with CIFAR CNN: 87.76 %

## Experiment

Either I coded them wrong, or it doesn't work
