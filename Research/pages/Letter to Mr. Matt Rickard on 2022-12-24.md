Dear Mr. [[Matt Rickard|Rickard]],

I'm on my way back to my home from [[서울|Seoul]] to Daejeon in [[대한민국|Korea]], and I just got this post — I love this post!

There are countless cases where [[Twitter]] troubled up, but the above point is the most prominent one. [[Elon Musk|Musk]] does seem to desire "free money," as you pointed out, based on his track record for a couple of weeks. But before that, he hinted at his desire for a [[Super App]]. What concerns me more is the "[[Super App]]" that [[Elon Musk|Musk]] wanted to build.

You mentioned a couple of times about a potential [[Super App]] in the [[United States of America|US]], but this may be a very alarming scenario for the people in the [[United States of America|United States]].

From my native [[한민족|Korean]] experience, the [[Super App]] is mighty and dangerous. We have a [[Super App]] called [[Kakao]], a go-to for everything. It's [[Google]] + [[Facebook]] + Uber + Uber Eats + Netflix + Spotify + AirBnB. [[Kakao]] had an outage last October for about a week, and... It wasn't good. All of the economies stopped.

I know [[Elon Musk|Musk]] is a very inconsistent person. He could take one day order to build a [[Super App]] platform. And that could change silicon valley once and for all.

As Jobs said, [[Elon Musk|Musk]] can "put a dent" in the universe. Would that be the rise of the blue bird into a mighty Phoenix? Or would this be the last flapping of the once-powerful hawk?

I don't know — perhaps [[Elon Musk|Musk]] fired too much to rewrite stuff!

P.S. I hope my [[Mail|emails]] are okay with you! I love thought-invoking posts, and I pay massive attention to the Silicon Valley stories — I have been, and still to this day, loving your posts!

Best regards,

Sunghyun
