Imposter syndrome is a psychological condition that involves self-doubt and personal incompetence. People with imposter syndrome doubt their skills, talents, or accomplishments and have a persistent fear of being exposed as frauds. They may believe that they are undeserving of their achievements and that people will soon discover the truth about them. Imposter syndrome can disproportionately affect high-achieving people who find it difficult to accept their accomplishments. To counter these feelings, people with imposter syndrome may work harder and hold themselves to higher standards. There is no single cause of imposter syndrome, but research points to culture and environment as factors, such as family dynamics and the roles people learn early in life.
