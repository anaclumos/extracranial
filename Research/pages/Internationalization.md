In software development, i18n involves designing a product so it can be easily adapted to various languages and regions without requiring engineering changes. This is typically accomplished by separating all locale-specific elements (like date and time formats, currencies, text strings, etc.) from the source code, making it easy to add new localized versions or update existing ones.
