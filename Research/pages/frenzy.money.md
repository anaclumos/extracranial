## Purchase Points

Trading volume spike of >20x with modest price gain (<20-30%) often signals strong buying opportunity for further upside potential.

## Trading Patterns

### Beginner

10x+ volume spike → next-day decline volume → rebound. Clear entry points.

### Continuous

Multiple days of rising prices + high volume. Complex entries.

### Delayed

High volume + `<10%` price gain → sharp price increase. Clear entries, high returns.

## Risk Management

- Must have automatic stop-loss orders (set it to around -30%)
- Set purchase points between the opening and low prices during trading hours

## Selling Strategy

### Holding Period

3-day moving average rises sharply above the 5-day moving average

### Partial Sale

Sell 50% when both moving averages become horizontal and parallel

### Complete Exit

Execute when the 3-day and 5-day moving averages intersect

## Additional Considerations

- Most rapidly rising stocks typically experience multiple surges rather than a single rise
- Entering the position the day after identifying the initial surge tends to be most effective
- Recommended to analyze patterns by sorting stocks by trading volume in stock screening tools
