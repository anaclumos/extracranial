Apple Vision Pro is very impressive, but I got eye strain after 30 minutes. The remote display is pretty good, but realistically I don't see myself using that often. 3D games were very impressive; it was as if the game boards were on my table.

Many iPad apps work out of the box. 1Password also worked. However not having Netflix and YouTube was a pretty huge deal breaker.
