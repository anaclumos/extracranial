Same as UUID, but what if it uses 36-based randomized alphanumerics (A-Z, 0-9)?

Possibility of UUID Collision: After generating 1 billion UUIDs every second for the next 100 years, the [[probability]] of creating just one duplicate would be about 50%. Or, to put it another way, the [[probability]] of one duplicate would be about 50% if everyone owned 600 million UUIDs on earth.
