> In computer programming, a shim is a library that transparently intercepts [[API]] calls and changes the arguments passed, handles the operation itself or redirects the operation elsewhere. Shims can be used to support an old [[API]] in a newer environment or a new [[API]] in an older environment. Shims can also be used to run programs on different software platforms than were developed for. [Shim (computing)](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shim_(computing)>)
