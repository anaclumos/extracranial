The search never ended to find the perfect [[ebook]]. Refer to this [[Hacker News|HN]] thread

> I just saw the [[Kindle]] Scribe launch, but it still does not satisfy my needed features, albeit being my near-perfect version of [[Kindle]]. First and foremost, I would want to have a good e-reader with multiple e-book store vendors (no lock-ins), with additional features like the following:

> - USB-C
> - Decently large screen
> - Pen support
> - Decently long-lasting battery (more than 20 hours of reading time is enough for me)
> - Decent Note-taking & highlighting features
> - Decent software (Onyx fails here)
> - Pretty easy way to send & open files on the device (for PDFs, PPTXs, [[EPUB]]s)

> Recent [[Kindle]] versions check almost all checkboxes here, but I would love to see multiple e-book vendors. I also read many Korean books, and the [[Kindle]] store lacks Korean titles. Knowing that Amazon loses money for each [[Kindle]] sale to boost their [[Kindle]] store revenue, it seems unlikely that [[Kindle]] will open up external app support.

While the search to find the best [[ebook]] reader is yet to finish, a recent discovery on [[2023-01-12]] suggested that if the digital tool [[Tools Must Vanish|vanish]]es, digital tools no longer matter â€” essentially solving the [[Digital Addiction]].

Furthermore, I fell in love with [[Book Scanning]] as a [[PDF]] with [[OCR]], and I figured it is very lovable. I can't understand why [[Ridi]] and [[Kindle]] make the purchased book un-exportable.
