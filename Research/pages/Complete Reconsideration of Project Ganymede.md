Project Ganymede should undergo a comprehensive rebranding effort to better communicate its value proposition and enhance its market appeal. The current branding lacks a clear and concise message, requiring extensive explanations that diminish its impact.

## Rebranding Focus

1. **Inability to Take Screenshots**. The rebranding will emphasize the project's unique feature of preventing users from taking screenshots. This will be the primary selling point and will be prominently highlighted in all marketing materials and product descriptions.
2. **Simplicity in Naming**. The new name for the project will be simple, straightforward, and easily memorable. "No Shots" has been proposed as a potential name, clearly conveying the project's core functionality. Avoiding overly pedantic names will ensure that the product is accessible and appealing to a wider audience.
3. **User Interface Simplification**. The user interface will be streamlined to consist of a single picture, making it intuitive and user-friendly. A camera icon will be incorporated into the interface to visually reinforce the project's screenshot prevention feature.
4. **Domain Name Selection**. The suggested domain name for the project is "noshot.app". This domain name is concise, memorable, and aligns with the rebranding strategy. Acquiring this domain name will be a priority to establish a strong online presence and brand identity.
