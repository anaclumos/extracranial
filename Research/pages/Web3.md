### [You Can Forget About Crypto Now - The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2022/11/sam-bankman-fried-bankruptcy-crypto-ftx/672104/)
- This week, Bankman-Fried lost his entire fortune virtually over a single day, in what Bloomberg [has called](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-11-11/sam-bankman-fried-s-assets-go-from-16-billion-to-zero-after-ftx-collapse) “one of history’s greatest-ever destructions of wealth
- But now, crypto feels less ready for the mainstream than it has in years
- The fall began with [a story](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/11/02/divisions-in-sam-bankman-frieds-crypto-empire-blur-on-his-trading-titan-alamedas-balance-sheet/) from the CoinDesk reporter Ian Allison suggesting that SBF’s companies were far more interconnected than anyone knew
- FTX found itself having trouble paying out withdrawals to customers. Suddenly, a company once worth $32 billion was $8 billion in the hole. Zhao initially said Binance would buy FTX for scrap but backed out once he got a look at the books. FTX was never a bank; customers will be lucky to get even a fraction of their money back in bankruptcy court over the next few years, and it seems possible that SBF will face serious legal repercussions
- Crypto will always persist in some form, but the future of crypto as an institution—as something that might one day destabilize the big banks or at least operate in parallel—has never been less certain

### [Is web3 bullshit? (Transcript)](https://blog.mollywhite.net/is-web3-bullshit/)

- There was this new word everywhere: “web3”. The future of the web, I was being told, was going to be powered by crypto and blockchains. I was reading that, finally, we were going to fix the web
- At that time, they were talking about the [Semantic Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web). Some of you who watched the Centre stage talks earlier this morning probably saw [Tim Berners-Lee talking about Web 3.0](https://youtu.be/D5p2gt7htDM?t=2251), which, again, he defines very differently from the crypto version of web3
- The oligopoly of Andreessen Horowitz, or its investments in the same Big Tech companies that they now decried, including Facebook, Instagram, and others, went conspicuously unmentioned
- You see, if they can convince people that this is the future of the web, they’ll be rich… richer than they already are
- So-called web3 publishing firms sought to reinvent DRM, imposing even more limits on how textbooks or other material could be resold so that companies could squeeze out even more money from their users at more steps along the way
- Censorship-resistant” blockchain social networks became saturated with spam, driving away their actual users
- Users who were convinced to buy tokens to “invest” into the “future of finance”, the “future of the web”, were hacked and scammed and phished and rug-pulled
- when an entire industry emerges and begins to sell this idea to the general public that a better web is only possible through a technology that shows little indication of being up to the task? When it preys on people’s hopes for a future of a better web and their fears about the effects of the current web on themselves, their children, and society to convince them to buy in—literally—to projects that may never even exist. When it sidesteps regulations on early-stage investing through token offerings and convinces ordinary people that their only way to financial stability is to bet their savings on technologies that they don’t understand because “this is the future
- So far, the primary successes of web3 have been in shiny marketing, selling people the opportunity to invest in vaporware
- There will be a web3. The web has been evolving ever since its inception, and there is no doubt in my mind that we are overdue for a fundamental shift. Will it be blockchains and crypto? Venture capitalists and blockchain startup founders hope that you think so
- But when presented with lofty promises, we must remember distinguishing steam-powered computers from genuinely revolutionary ones.
- Dig deep. Ask the hard questions. Criticize the flaws. And cut through the bullshit
