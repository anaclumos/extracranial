## Intro

- Data exists in isolated islands
- More security required

### First [[Federated Machine Learning|FML]] framework by [[Google]], 2016

- Horizontal [[Federated Machine Learning|FL]]
- Vertical [[Federated Machine Learning|FL]]
- Federated Transfer Learnings

### Traditional Data Processing Models

- aka Simple Data Transaction Model
- 3 parties
  - Data Collector
  - Data Sanitizer
  - ML Trainer
- Privacy concerns

## Overview

- aim to extend to **all privacy-preserving decentralized collaborative [[ML|machine learning]] techniques.**
- simple definition
  - $N$ parties federate their data without exposing them to each other to attain performance closely comparable to the model trained as if all the information were gathered.

## Secure Multi-party Computation
