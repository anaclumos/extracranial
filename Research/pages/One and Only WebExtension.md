- [[Someday]] [[Project]]
- A [[Safari]] and [[Firefox]] [[WebExtension|extension]] that disguises itself as [[Chrome]] and runs all [[Chrome]] Extensions.
- It will essentially be a VM of [[Chrome]] Extensions — This One and Only [[WebExtension]] will install [[Chrome]] [[WebExtension|Extension]] within itself and proxy all of the requests to [[Safari]] & [[Firefox|FF]].
