### [Large language models have their Stable Diffusion moment](https://simonwillison.net/2023/Mar/11/llama/)

- The forthcoming release of the Stable Diffusion image generation model in August 2022 was pivotal. I wrote how [Stable Diffusion is a big deal](https://simonwillison.net/2022/Aug/29/stable-diffusion/) at the time.
- People could now generate images from the text on their hardware!
- More importantly, developers could mess around with the guts of what was going on
- LLaMA
  - Somewhat surprisingly, language models like GPT-3 that power tools like ChatGPT are a lot larger and more expensive to build and operate than image generation models
  - LLaMA on its own isn't much good if it's still too hard to run it on a personal laptop
