- Interviewed on [[2022-09-13]]
- Currently works at Marvell Semiconductors

**Academia**.
I studied Applied Engineering in Physics for a while in Academia. I wanted to focus on something that has more emphasis on Academia rather than on the industry. I remember enjoying Logic Designs and Computer Architecture; with my physics background, I decided to study electrical computing. There aren't many things you can do in clubs in EE. I worked in campus research labs and was introduced to Marvell by a professor. I got rejected initially but got a return offer, and now I am working at Marvell.

**Interview**.
Electrical engineering questions, like logic designs and semiconductor units.

**Responsibilities**.
I create functional [[Simulations]] models for semiconductors. For fabless labs, you have to write semiconductor software before getting your hands on the fabricated chips from the factory. I write software to simulate semiconductors that helps program semiconductors without semiconductors.

**Recommendations**.
Meet a lot of people.
