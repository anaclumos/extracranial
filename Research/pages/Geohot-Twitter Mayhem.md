**Twitter's Missing Search [[Engine]]**.

George Hotz, also known as Geohot, is a famous [[hacker]] and founder of Comma.[[ai]]. [[Elon Musk]] hired him to work on Twitter to improve its search functionality. However, after only a month, he resigned from his Twitter internship, saying he was unhappy with the work environment and lack of freedom.

- Geohot said as if he could solve all the issues,
- Then looked for a one-liner [[front-end]] solution for "fixing the search problem"
- and eventually quit without delivering any of the solutions.

It's not that Geohot is overrated. But it still poses a question for ① being a superintelligent [[10x]] developer and ② being a cooperative team player developer. Geohot was the first, whereas Twitter needed the second.
