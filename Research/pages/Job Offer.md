[Ten Rules for Negotiating a Job Offer](https://haseebq.com/my-ten-rules-for-negotiating-a-job-offer/)

## Mindset Shifts

### You're selling labor, not "getting a job"

Think of employment as a mutual business deal, not a favor.

### Negotiation is expected

It signals competence and seriousness; not negotiating is a missed opportunity.

### Negotiation is a learnable skill

It's not innate--anyone can improve with the right approach.

## The Ten Rules

### Get everything in writing

Record all offer details, even verbal ones. Confirm via email to create a paper trail.

### Always keep the door open

Avoid premature commitments. Don't let recruiters corner you into decisions.

### Information is power

Don't reveal your current salary or desired compensation. Maintain ambiguity to preserve leverage.

### Always be positive

Stay enthusiastic about the company, even if the offer is weak. Excitement increases your perceived value.

### Don't be the decision-maker

Reference external decision-makers (e.g., family, mentors) to deflect pressure and buy time.

### Have alternatives

Other offers increase your leverage. Even the perception of alternatives boosts your value.

### Proclaim reasons for everything

Justify every request with a rational explanation. It makes you appear thoughtful, not greedy.

### Be motivated by more than just money

Express interest in the company's mission or team. It builds trust and goodwill.

### Understand what they value

Tailor your negotiation to the company's priorities (e.g., speed, cultural fit, commitment).

### Be winnable

Signal that you can be closed. Don't be opaque or overly difficult.

## Tactical Advice

### Use offers to generate more offers

Notify other companies when you receive an offer to accelerate their timelines.

### Exploding offers should be challenged

Treat any offer with an unreasonable deadline as a non-offer--ask for more time.

### Time your interviews strategically

Start with slower-moving companies so all your offers arrive within the same window.

### Stay curious and empathetic

Understand the employer's constraints and goals. Empathy makes you a better negotiator.
