**The Website On Which the Sun Never Sets refers to a website that is always active and in use by at least one user, with a global reach that allows it to be accessed from any location at any time of day or night.**
The concept of "The Website On Which the Sun Never Sets" is a modern metaphorical expression that refers to the global nature and constant activity of the internet. Just as the [[United Kingdom|British]] Empire once had territories and colonies across multiple continents and time zones, the internet is a worldwide network that is always active and accessible anywhere.

To determine if a website fits the concept of "The Website On Which the Sun Never Sets," we can use the formula of average visitors per day multiplied by the average stay time.

$$
{\text{Visitors} \over \text{24 hours}} \times {\text{Stay Time} \over \text{24 hours}} > 1?
$$

If this number exceeds 1, someone is always on the website at any given time. This is similar to how the [[United Kingdom|British]] Empire was said to have had territories in every time zone and, therefore, always had some part of it experiencing daylight.
