At one point in history, Apple was known to experiment with this with MacBook Pro 2016 release. They used e-ink for adaptive keyboards. Then they scraped it, and rumors indicated they moved to [[OLED]], now seen on touch-bar macs. The rumor, however, did not end on the touch bar; the entire keyboard area was made with [[OLED]] buttons.
