Welcome to my research note.
I grew up reading [The Encyclopedia of Absolute and Relative Knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%27Encyclop%C3%A9die_du_savoir_relatif_et_absolu) and envisioned a _single source of truth_ just like it that integrated my projects and research.
I am thrilled to present you with the incarnation of this vision.
You will find my most up-to-date interests here.

One scientist envisioned something called [[Memex]] when transistors were invented.
Memex, as a device that stores and indexes all information and knowledge of a person, is known to be the first description of the internet.
This place **faithfully** implements Memex with modern technology.
Unlike ordinary websites, this place is non-linear.
There are no next/previous posts, parent/child folders, or domain structures, and everything gets regularly rearranged.
No information retains its _physical_ form; everything is handled by metadata, with front matters and hyperlinks.
What's so good that way? Unparalleled flexibility.

## Tech Stacks

I use [[Obsidian]] for taking notes.
I then pipeline those notes into heavily customized [[TypeScript]] [[Docusaurus]] with custom [[React]] components.
I finally use [[Vercel]] for deploying, caching, and distributing.
I open-sourced it on [GitHub](https://github.com/anaclumos/extracranial).
Take a look! 😃
