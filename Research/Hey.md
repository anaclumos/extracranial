## Welcome!

> This is my personal [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia).
> This is everything I know!

Welcome to my research note.
I grew up reading [The Encyclopedia of Absolute and Relative Knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%27Encyclop%C3%A9die_du_savoir_relatif_et_absolu) and envisioned a _single source of truth_ just like it that integrated my projects and research.
I am thrilled to present you with the incarnation of this vision.

## Extracranial: The Exosuit for [[Superbrain|Superbrains]] and a superset of [[Memex]]

In [[As We May Think]], [[Vannevar Bush]], a legendary scientist, describes [[Memex]] as

```
an electromechanical device enabling individuals
* to develop comprehensive research libraries
* to create and follow associative trails of links and annotations
* to recall these trails at any time
* to share them with other researchers
```

This idea would later be implemented as the **Internet**. However, I, Sunghyun Cho, felt that the Internet helps keep records of humanity but is insufficient for capturing the individual's brain. Therefore, this website, Project [[Aldehyde]], aims to create a superset of [[Memex]].

Therefore, this website is

```diff
+ A practical implementation of
an electromechanical device enabling individuals
* to develep comprehensive research libraries
* to create and follow associative trails of links and annotations
* to recall these trails at any time
* to share them with other researchers
+ * in order to contain every single idea of Sunghyun Cho
```

Thus, the name [[Extracranial]], — **The Exosuit for [[Superbrain|Superbrains]]**.

## Before Everything

My opinions on various topics have changed significantly over time, and in some cases, I now hold the exact opposite view compared to when I originally wrote certain articles. I am open to changing my mind and welcome persuasive arguments that challenge my current beliefs. This process of constant re-evaluation is an essential part of my intellectual growth.

Please understand that this Wikipedia serves as a record of my thoughts at specific moments in the past. Many of my older articles contain opinions that no longer align with my current perspectives, outdated information, or incorrectly understood facts. As such, I prefer not to have my old articles brought up, as they do not accurately represent my present stance on the issues discussed. Keep this in mind when reading my earlier works.

## Tech Stacks

I use [[Obsidian]] for taking notes.
I then pipeline those notes into heavily customized [[TypeScript]] [[Docusaurus]] with custom [[React]] components.
I finally use [[AWS Fargate]] and [[FlightControl]] for deploying, [[caching]], and distributing.
I open-sourced it on [GitHub](https://github.com/anaclumos/extracranial).
Take a look! 😃
