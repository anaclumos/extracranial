## Welcome!

> This is everything I know!

Welcome to my research note.
I grew up reading [The Encyclopedia of Absolute and Relative Knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%27Encyclop%C3%A9die_du_savoir_relatif_et_absolu) and envisioned a _single source of truth_ just like it that integrated my projects and research.
I am thrilled to present you with the incarnation of this vision.

## Extracranial: The Exosuit for [[Superbrain|Superbrains]] and a superset of [[Memex]]

In [[As We May Think]], [[Vannevar Bush]], a legendary scientist, describes [[Memex]] as

```
an electromechanical device enabling individuals
* to develop comprehensive research libraries
* to create and follow associative trails of links and annotations
* to recall these trails at any time
* to share them with other researchers
```

This idea would later be implemented as the **Internet**. However, I, Sunghyun Cho, felt that the Internet helps keep records of humanity but is insufficient for capturing the individual's brain. Therefore, this website, Project [[Aldehyde]], aims to create a superset of [[Memex]].

Therefore, this website is

```diff
+ A practical implementation of
an electromechanical device enabling individuals
* to develep comprehensive research libraries
* to create and follow associative trails of links and annotations
* to recall these trails at any time
* to share them with other researchers
+ * in order to contain every single idea of Sunghyun Cho
```

Thus, the name [[Extracranial]], — **The Exosuit for [[Superbrain|Superbrains]]**.

## Tech Stacks

I use [[Obsidian]] for taking notes.
I then pipeline those notes into heavily customized [[TypeScript]] [[Docusaurus]] with custom [[React]] components.
I finally use [[AWS Fargate]] and [[FlightControl]] for deploying, [[caching]], and distributing.
I open-sourced it on [GitHub](https://github.com/anaclumos/extracranial).
Take a look! 😃
