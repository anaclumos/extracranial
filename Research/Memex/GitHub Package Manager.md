### [GitHub's Missing Package Manager](https://matt-rickard.com/githubs-missing-package-manager/)

- Squatters sit on a popular name
- (Malicious) Code does not match what's on GitHub
- The package is maintained by someone else, not the author of the code
- GitHub is updated, but the author hasn't published the release to a package manager.
