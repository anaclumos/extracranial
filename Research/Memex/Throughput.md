> Network throughput (or just throughput, when in context) refers to the rate of successful message delivery over a communication channel, such as Ethernet or packet radio, in a communication network. These messages' data may be delivered over physical or logical links or through network nodes. Throughput is usually measured in bits per second (bit/s or bps) and sometimes in data packets per second (p/s or PPS) or data packets per time slot.
